Every man is an inlet to the\\nsame and to all of the same. He that is once admitted to the right of reason is\\nmade a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what\\na saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man, he can\\nunderstand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or\\ncan be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent.', 'Of the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is illustrated by\\nthe entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing less than all his\\nhistory. Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit goes forth from the\\nbeginning to embody every faculty, every thought, every emotion, which belongs\\nto it, in appropriate events. But the thought is always prior to the fact; all\\nthe facts of history preexist in the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by\\ncircumstances predominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a\\ntime. A man is the whole encyclopaedia of facts. The creation of a thousand\\nforests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, lie\\nfolded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp, kingdom, empire,\\nrepublic, democracy, are merely the application of his manifold spirit to the\\nmanifold world.', 'This human mind wrote history, and this must read it. The Sphinx must solve her\\nown riddle. If the whole of history is in one man, it is all to be explained\\nfrom individual experience. There is a relation between the hours of our life\\nand the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is drawn from the great\\nrepositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred\\nmillions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium\\nof centrifugal and centripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed by the\\nages and the ages explained by the hours. Of the universal mind each individual\\nman is one more incarnation. All its properties consist in him. Each new fact\\nin his private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men have\\ndone, and the crises of his life refer to national crises. Every revolution was\\nfirst a thought in one man’s mind, and when the same thought occurs to\\nanother man, it is the key to that era. Every reform was once a private\\nopinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again it will solve the problem\\nof the age. The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be credible\\nor intelligible. We, as we read, must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and\\nking, martyr and executioner; must fasten these images to some reality in our\\nsecret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or\\nCæsar Borgia is as much an illustration of the mind’s powers and\\ndepravations as what has befallen us. Each new law and political movement has\\nmeaning for you. Stand before each of its tablets and say, ‘Under this\\nmask did my Proteus nature hide itself.’ This remedies the defect of our\\ntoo great nearness to ourselves. This throws our actions into perspective; and\\nas crabs, goats, scorpions, the balance and the waterpot lose their meanness\\nwhen hung as signs in the zodiac, so I can see my own vices without heat in the\\ndistant persons of Solomon, Alcibiades, and Catiline.', 'It is the universal nature which gives worth to particular men and things.\\nHuman life, as containing this, is mysterious and inviolable, and we hedge it\\nround with penalties and laws. All laws derive hence their ultimate reason; all\\nexpress more or less distinctly some command of this supreme, illimitable\\nessence. Property also holds of the soul, covers great spiritual facts, and\\ninstinctively we at first hold to it with swords and laws and wide and complex\\ncombinations. The obscure consciousness of this fact is the light of all our\\nday, the claim of claims; the plea for education, for justice, for charity; the\\nfoundation of friendship and love and of the heroism and grandeur which belong\\nto acts of self-reliance. It is remarkable that involuntarily we always read as\\nsuperior beings. Universal history, the poets, the romancers, do not in their\\nstateliest pictures,—in the sacerdotal, the imperial palaces, in the\\ntriumphs of will or of genius,—anywhere lose our ear, anywhere make us\\nfeel that we intrude, that this is for better men; but rather is it true that\\nin their grandest strokes we feel most at home. All that Shakspeare says of the\\nking, yonder slip of a boy that reads in the corner feels to be true of\\nhimself. We sympathize in the great moments of history, in the great\\ndiscoveries, the great resistances, the great prosperities of\\nmen;—because there law was enacted, the sea was searched, the land was\\nfound, or the blow was struck, for us, as we ourselves in that place\\nwould have done or applauded.', 'We have the same interest in condition and character. We honor the rich because\\nthey have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we feel to be proper\\nto man, proper to us. So all that is said of the wise man by Stoic or Oriental\\nor modern essayist, describes to each reader his own idea, describes his\\nunattained but attainable self. All literature writes the character of the wise\\nman. Books, monuments, pictures, conversation, are portraits in which he finds\\nthe lineaments he is forming. The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost\\nhim, and he is stimulated wherever he moves, as by personal allusions. A true\\naspirant therefore never needs look for allusions personal and laudatory in\\ndiscourse. He hears the commendation, not of himself, but, more sweet, of that\\ncharacter he seeks, in every word that is said concerning character, yea\\nfurther in every fact and circumstance,—in the running river and the\\nrustling corn. Praise is looked, homage tendered, love flows, from mute nature,\\nfrom the mountains and the lights of the firmament.', 'These hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night, let us use in broad day.\\nThe student is to read history actively and not passively; to esteem his own\\nlife the text, and books the commentary. Thus compelled, the Muse of history\\nwill utter oracles, as never to those who do not respect themselves. I have no\\nexpectation that any man will read history aright who thinks that what was done\\nin a remote age, by men whose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense\\nthan what he is doing to-day.', 'The world exists for the education of each man. There is no age or state of\\nsociety or mode of action in history to which there is not somewhat\\ncorresponding in his life. Every thing tends in a wonderful manner to\\nabbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him. He should see that he can\\nlive all history in his own person. He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer\\nhimself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know that he is greater than all\\nthe geography and all the government of the world; he must transfer the point\\nof view from which history is commonly read, from Rome and Athens and London,\\nto himself, and not deny his conviction that he is the court, and if England or\\nEgypt have any thing to say to him he will try the case; if not, let them for\\never be silent. He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield\\ntheir secret sense, and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct of the mind,\\nthe purpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the signal\\nnarrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of\\nfacts. No anchor, no cable, no fences avail to keep a fact a fact. Babylon,\\nTroy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome are passing already into fiction.\\nThe Garden of Eden, the sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward\\nto all nations. Who cares what the fact was, when we have made a constellation\\nof it to hang in heaven an immortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go\\nthe same way. “What is history,” said Napoleon, “but a fable\\nagreed upon?” This life of ours is stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul,\\nEngland, War, Colonization, Church, Court and Commerce, as with so many flowers\\nand wild ornaments grave and gay. I will not make more account of them. I\\nbelieve in Eternity. I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain and the\\nIslands,—the genius and creative principle of each and of all eras, in my\\nown mind.', 'We are always coming up with the emphatic facts of history in our private\\nexperience and verifying them here. All history becomes subjective; in other\\nwords there is properly no history, only biography. Every mind must know the\\nwhole lesson for itself,—must go over the whole ground. What it does not\\nsee, what it does not live, it will not know. What the former age has\\nepitomized into a formula or rule for manipular convenience, it will lose all\\nthe good of verifying for itself, by means of the wall of that rule. Somewhere,\\nsometime, it will demand and find compensation for that loss, by doing the work\\nitself. Ferguson discovered many things in astronomy which had long been known.\\nThe better for him.', 'History must be this or it is nothing. Every law which the state enacts\\nindicates a fact in human nature; that is all. We must in ourselves see the\\nnecessary reason of every fact,—see how it could and must be. So stand\\nbefore every public and private work; before an oration of Burke, before a\\nvictory of Napoleon, before a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of Sidney, of\\nMarmaduke Robinson; before a French Reign of Terror, and a Salem hanging of\\nwitches; before a fanatic Revival and the Animal Magnetism in Paris, or in\\nProvidence. We assume that we under like influence should be alike affected,\\nand should achieve the like; and we aim to master intellectually the steps and\\nreach the same height or the same degradation that our fellow, our proxy has\\ndone.', 'All inquiry into antiquity, all curiosity respecting the Pyramids, the\\nexcavated cities, Stonehenge, the Ohio Circles, Mexico, Memphis,—is the\\ndesire to do away this wild, savage, and preposterous There or Then, and\\nintroduce in its place the Here and the Now. Belzoni digs and measures in the\\nmummy-pits and pyramids of Thebes, until he can see the end of the difference\\nbetween the monstrous work and himself. When he has satisfied himself, in\\ngeneral and in detail, that it was made by such a person as he, so armed and so\\nmotived, and to ends to which he himself should also have worked, the problem\\nis solved; his thought lives along the whole line of temples and sphinxes and\\ncatacombs, passes through them all with satisfaction, and they live again to\\nthe mind, or are now.', 'A Gothic cathedral affirms that it was done by us and not done by us. Surely it\\nwas by man, but we find it not in our man. But we apply ourselves to the\\nhistory of its production. We put ourselves into the place and state of the\\nbuilder. We remember the forest-dwellers, the first temples, the adherence to\\nthe first type, and the decoration of it as the wealth of the nation increased;\\nthe value which is given to wood by carving led to the carving over the whole\\nmountain of stone of a cathedral. When we have gone through this process, and\\nadded thereto the Catholic Church, its cross, its music, its processions, its\\nSaints’ days and image-worship, we have as it were been the man that made\\nthe minster; we have seen how it could and must be. We have the sufficient\\nreason.', 'The difference between men is in their principle of association. Some men\\nclassify objects by color and size and other accidents of appearance; others by\\nintrinsic likeness, or by the relation of cause and effect. The progress of the\\nintellect is to the clearer vision of causes, which neglects surface\\ndifferences. To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are\\nfriendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men divine. For\\nthe eye is fastened on the life, and slights the circumstance. Every chemical\\nsubstance, every plant, every animal in its growth, teaches the unity of cause,\\nthe variety of appearance.', 'Upborne and surrounded as we are by this all-creating nature, soft and fluid as\\na cloud or the air, why should we be such hard pedants, and magnify a few\\nforms? Why should we make account of time, or of magnitude, or of figure? The\\nsoul knows them not, and genius, obeying its law, knows how to play with them\\nas a young child plays with graybeards and in churches. Genius studies the\\ncausal thought, and far back in the womb of things sees the rays parting from\\none orb, that diverge, ere they fall, by infinite diameters. Genius watches the\\nmonad through all his masks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature. Genius\\ndetects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the grub, through the\\negg, the constant individual; through countless individuals the fixed species;\\nthrough many species the genus; through all genera the steadfast type; through\\nall the kingdoms of organized life the eternal unity. Nature is a mutable cloud\\nwhich is always and never the same. She casts the same thought into troops of\\nforms, as a poet makes twenty fables with one moral. Through the bruteness and\\ntoughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will. The\\nadamant streams into soft but precise form before it, and whilst I look at it\\nits outline and texture are changed again. Nothing is so fleeting as form; yet\\nnever does it quite deny itself. In man we still trace the remains or hints of\\nall that we esteem badges of servitude in the lower races; yet in him they\\nenhance his nobleness and grace; as Io, in Æschylus, transformed to a cow,\\noffends the imagination; but how changed when as Isis in Egypt she meets\\nOsiris-Jove, a beautiful woman with nothing of the metamorphosis left but the\\nlunar horns as the splendid ornament of her brows!', 'The identity of history is equally intrinsic, the diversity equally obvious.\\nThere is, at the surface, infinite variety of things; at the centre there is\\nsimplicity of cause. How many are the acts of one man in which we recognize the\\nsame character! Observe the sources of our information in respect to the Greek\\ngenius. We have the civil history of that people, as Herodotus,\\nThucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch have given it; a very sufficient account of\\nwhat manner of persons they were and what they did. We have the same national\\nmind expressed for us again in their literature, in epic and lyric\\npoems, drama, and philosophy; a very complete form. Then we have it once more\\nin their architecture, a beauty as of temperance itself, limited to the\\nstraight line and the square,—a builded geometry. Then we have it once\\nagain in sculpture, the “tongue on the balance of\\nexpression,” a multitude of forms in the utmost freedom of action and\\nnever transgressing the ideal serenity; like votaries performing some religious\\ndance before the gods, and, though in convulsive pain or mortal combat, never\\ndaring to break the figure and decorum of their dance. Thus of the genius of\\none remarkable people we have a fourfold representation: and to the senses what\\nmore unlike than an ode of Pindar, a marble centaur, the peristyle of the\\nParthenon, and the last actions of Phocion?', 'Every one must have observed faces and forms which, without any resembling\\nfeature, make a like impression on the beholder. A particular picture or copy\\nof verses, if it do not awaken the same train of images, will yet superinduce\\nthe same sentiment as some wild mountain walk, although the resemblance is\\nnowise obvious to the senses, but is occult and out of the reach of the\\nunderstanding. Nature is an endless combination and repetition of a very few\\nlaws. She hums the old well-known air through innumerable variations.', 'Nature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her works, and delights\\nin startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected quarters. I have seen\\nthe head of an old sachem of the forest which at once reminded the eye of a\\nbald mountain summit, and the furrows of the brow suggested the strata of the\\nrock. There are men whose manners have the same essential splendor as the\\nsimple and awful sculpture on the friezes of the Parthenon and the remains of\\nthe earliest Greek art. And there are compositions of the same strain to be\\nfound in the books of all ages. What is Guido’s Rospigliosi Aurora but a\\nmorning thought, as the horses in it are only a morning cloud? If any one will\\nbut take pains to observe the variety of actions to which he is equally\\ninclined in certain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse, he will see\\nhow deep is the chain of affinity.', 'A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort becoming a\\ntree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form merely,—but,\\nby watching for a time his motions and plays, the painter enters into his\\nnature and can then draw him at will in every attitude. So Roos “entered\\ninto the inmost nature of a sheep.” I knew a draughtsman employed in a\\npublic survey who found that he could not sketch the rocks until their\\ngeological structure was first explained to him. In a certain state of thought\\nis the common origin of very diverse works. It is the spirit and not the fact\\nthat is identical. By a deeper apprehension, and not primarily by a painful\\nacquisition of many manual skills, the artist attains the power of awakening\\nother souls to a given activity.', 'It has been said that “common souls pay with what they do, nobler souls\\nwith that which they are.” And why? Because a profound nature awakens in\\nus by its actions and words, by its very looks and manners, the same power and\\nbeauty that a gallery of sculpture or of pictures addresses.', 'Civil and natural history, the history of art and of literature, must be\\nexplained from individual history, or must remain words. There is nothing but\\nis related to us, nothing that does not interest us,—kingdom, college,\\ntree, horse, or iron shoe,—the roots of all things are in man. Santa\\nCroce and the Dome of St. Peter’s are lame copies after a divine model.\\nStrasburg Cathedral is a material counterpart of the soul of Erwin of\\nSteinbach. The true poem is the poet’s mind; the true ship is the\\nship-builder. In the man, could we lay him open, we should see the reason for\\nthe last flourish and tendril of his work; as every spine and tint in the\\nsea-shell preexists in the secreting organs of the fish. The whole of heraldry\\nand of chivalry is in courtesy. A man of fine manners shall pronounce your name\\nwith all the ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.', 'The trivial experience of every day is always verifying some old prediction to\\nus and converting into things the words and signs which we had heard and seen\\nwithout heed. A lady with whom I was riding in the forest said to me that the\\nwoods always seemed to her to wait, as if the genii who inhabit them suspended\\ntheir deeds until the wayfarer had passed onward; a thought which poetry has\\ncelebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of\\nhuman feet. The man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at\\nmidnight, has been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of\\nthe world. I remember one summer day in the fields my companion pointed out to\\nme a broad cloud, which might extend a quarter of a mile parallel to the\\nhorizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over\\nchurches,—a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate with\\neyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-stretched symmetrical wings.\\nWhat appears once in the atmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly\\nthe archetype of that familiar ornament. I have seen in the sky a chain of\\nsummer lightning which at once showed to me that the Greeks drew from nature\\nwhen they painted the thunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift\\nalong the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common\\narchitectural scroll to abut a tower.', 'By surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent anew the\\norders and the ornaments of architecture, as we see how each people merely\\ndecorated its primitive abodes. The Doric temple preserves the semblance of the\\nwooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt. The Chinese pagoda is plainly a Tartar\\ntent. The Indian and Egyptian temples still betray the mounds and subterranean\\nhouses of their forefathers. “The custom of making houses and tombs in\\nthe living rock,” says Heeren in his Researches on the Ethiopians,\\n“determined very naturally the principal character of the Nubian Egyptian\\narchitecture to the colossal form which it assumed. In these caverns, already\\nprepared by nature, the eye was accustomed to dwell on huge shapes and masses,\\nso that when art came to the assistance of nature it could not move on a small\\nscale without degrading itself. What would statues of the usual size, or neat\\nporches and wings have been, associated with those gigantic halls before which\\nonly Colossi could sit as watchmen or lean on the pillars of the\\ninterior?”', 'The Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the forest trees,\\nwith all their boughs, to a festal or solemn arcade; as the bands about the\\ncleft pillars still indicate the green withes that tied them. No one can walk\\nin a road cut through pine woods, without being struck with the architectural\\nappearance of the grove, especially in winter, when the barrenness of all other\\ntrees shows the low arch of the Saxons. In the woods in a winter afternoon one\\nwill see as readily the origin of the stained glass window, with which the\\nGothic cathedrals are adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen through\\nthe bare and crossing branches of the forest. Nor can any lover of nature enter\\nthe old piles of Oxford and the English cathedrals, without feeling that the\\nforest overpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw and\\nplane still reproduced its ferns, its spikes of flowers, its locust, elm, oak,\\npine, fir and spruce.', 'The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone subdued by the insatiable demand\\nof harmony in man. The mountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower, with\\nthe lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial proportions and\\nperspective of vegetable beauty.', 'In like manner all public facts are to be individualized, all private facts are\\nto be generalized. Then at once History becomes fluid and true, and Biography\\ndeep and sublime. As the Persian imitated in the slender shafts and capitals of\\nhis architecture the stem and flower of the lotus and palm, so the Persian\\ncourt in its magnificent era never gave over the nomadism of its barbarous\\ntribes, but travelled from Ecbatana, where the spring was spent, to Susa in\\nsummer and to Babylon for the winter.', 'In the early history of Asia and Africa, Nomadism and Agriculture are the two\\nantagonist facts. The geography of Asia and of Africa necessitated a nomadic\\nlife. But the nomads were the terror of all those whom the soil or the\\nadvantages of a market had induced to build towns. Agriculture therefore was a\\nreligious injunction, because of the perils of the state from nomadism. And in\\nthese late and civil countries of England and America these propensities still\\nfight out the old battle, in the nation and in the individual. The nomads of\\nAfrica were constrained to wander, by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives\\nthe cattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy season and to\\ndrive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions. The nomads of Asia follow the\\npasturage from month to month. In America and Europe the nomadism is of trade\\nand curiosity; a progress, certainly, from the gad-fly of Astaboras to the\\nAnglo and Italo-mania of Boston Bay. Sacred cities, to which a periodical\\nreligious pilgrimage was enjoined, or stringent laws and customs, tending to\\ninvigorate the national bond, were the check on the old rovers; and the\\ncumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the itineracy of the\\npresent day. The antagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in\\nindividuals, as the love of adventure or the love of repose happens to\\npredominate. A man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid\\ndomestication, lives in his wagon and roams through all latitudes as easily as\\na Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or in the snow, he sleeps as warm, dines\\nwith as good appetite, and associates as happily as beside his own chimneys. Or\\nperhaps his facility is deeper seated, in the increased range of his faculties\\nof observation, which yield him points of interest wherever fresh objects meet\\nhis eyes. The pastoral nations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this\\nintellectual nomadism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind through the\\ndissipation of power on a miscellany of objects. The home-keeping wit, on the\\nother hand, is that continence or content which finds all the elements of life\\nin its own soil; and which has its own perils of monotony and deterioration, if\\nnot stimulated by foreign infusions.', 'Every thing the individual sees without him corresponds to his states of mind,\\nand every thing is in turn intelligible to him, as his onward thinking leads\\nhim into the truth to which that fact or series belongs.', 'The primeval world,—the Fore-World, as the Germans say,—I can dive\\nto it in myself as well as grope for it with researching fingers in catacombs,\\nlibraries, and the broken reliefs and torsos of ruined villas.', 'What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history, letters,\\nart, and poetry, in all its periods from the Heroic or Homeric age down to the\\ndomestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later? What\\nbut this, that every man passes personally through a Grecian period. The\\nGrecian state is the era of the bodily nature, the perfection of the\\nsenses,—of the spiritual nature unfolded in strict unity with the body.\\nIn it existed those human forms which supplied the sculptor with his models of\\nHercules, Phœbus, and Jove; not like the forms abounding in the streets of\\nmodern cities, wherein the face is a confused blur of features, but composed of\\nincorrupt, sharply defined and symmetrical features, whose eye-sockets are so\\nformed that it would be impossible for such eyes to squint and take furtive\\nglances on this side and on that, but they must turn the whole head. The\\nmanners of that period are plain and fierce. The reverence exhibited is for\\npersonal qualities; courage, address, self-command, justice, strength,\\nswiftness, a loud voice, a broad chest. Luxury and elegance are not known. A\\nsparse population and want make every man his own valet, cook, butcher and\\nsoldier, and the habit of supplying his own needs educates the body to\\nwonderful performances. Such are the Agamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far\\ndifferent is the picture Xenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the\\nRetreat of the Ten Thousand. “After the army had crossed the river\\nTeleboas in Armenia, there fell much snow, and the troops lay miserably on the\\nground covered with it. But Xenophon arose naked, and taking an axe, began to\\nsplit wood; whereupon others rose and did the like.” Throughout his army\\nexists a boundless liberty of speech. They quarrel for plunder, they wrangle\\nwith the generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as sharp-tongued as any\\nand sharper-tongued than most, and so gives as good as he gets. Who does not\\nsee that this is a gang of great boys, with such a code of honor and such lax\\ndiscipline as great boys have?', 'The costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the old literature,\\nis that the persons speak simply,—speak as persons who have great good\\nsense without knowing it, before yet the reflective habit has become the\\npredominant habit of the mind. Our admiration of the antique is not admiration\\nof the old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not reflective, but perfect in\\ntheir senses and in their health, with the finest physical organization in the\\nworld. Adults acted with the simplicity and grace of children. They made vases,\\ntragedies, and statues, such as healthy senses should,—that is, in good\\ntaste. Such things have continued to be made in all ages, and are now, wherever\\na healthy physique exists; but, as a class, from their superior organization,\\nthey have surpassed all. They combine the energy of manhood with the engaging\\nunconsciousness of childhood. The attraction of these manners is that they\\nbelong to man, and are known to every man in virtue of his being once a child;\\nbesides that there are always individuals who retain these characteristics. A\\nperson of childlike genius and inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our\\nlove of the Muse of Hellas. I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes. In\\nreading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks, mountains and\\nwaves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea. I feel the eternity of man,\\nthe identity of his thought. The Greek had it seems the same fellow-beings as\\nI. The sun and moon, water and fire, met his heart precisely as they meet mine.\\nThen the vaunted distinction between Greek and English, between Classic and\\nRomantic schools, seems superficial and pedantic. When a thought of Plato\\nbecomes a thought to me,—when a truth that fired the soul of Pindar fires\\nmine, time is no more. When I feel that we two meet in a perception, that our\\ntwo souls are tinged with the same hue, and do as it were run into one, why\\nshould I measure degrees of latitude, why should I count Egyptian years?', 'The student interprets the age of chivalry by his own age of chivalry, and the\\ndays of maritime adventure and circumnavigation by quite parallel miniature\\nexperiences of his own. To the sacred history of the world he has the same key.\\nWhen the voice of a prophet out of the deeps of antiquity merely echoes to him\\na sentiment of his infancy, a prayer of his youth, he then pierces to the truth\\nthrough all the confusion of tradition and the caricature of institutions.', 'Rare, extravagant spirits come by us at intervals, who disclose to us new facts\\nin nature.

I cannot find any antiquity in them. They\\nare mine as much as theirs.', 'I have seen the first monks and anchorets, without crossing seas or centuries.\\nMore than once some individual has appeared to me with such negligence of labor\\nand such commanding contemplation, a haughty beneficiary begging in the name of\\nGod, as made good to the nineteenth century Simeon the Stylite, the Thebais,\\nand the first Capuchins.', 'The priestcraft of the East and West, of the Magian, Brahmin, Druid, and Inca,\\nis expounded in the individual’s private life.

The fact teaches him how Belus was worshipped and how the Pyramids were\\nbuilt, better than the discovery by Champollion of the names of all the workmen\\nand the cost of every tile. He finds Assyria and the Mounds of Cholula at his\\ndoor, and himself has laid the courses.', 'Again, in that protest which each considerate person makes against the\\nsuperstition of his times, he repeats step for step the part of old reformers,\\nand in the search after truth finds, like them, new perils to virtue.

How many times in\\nthe history of the world has the Luther of the day had to lament the decay of\\npiety in his own household! “Doctor,” said his wife to Martin\\nLuther, one day, “how is it that whilst subject to papacy we prayed so\\noften and with such fervor, whilst now we pray with the utmost coldness and\\nvery seldom?”', 'The advancing man discovers how deep a property he has in literature,—in\\nall fable as well as in all history. He finds that the poet was no odd fellow\\nwho described strange and impossible situations, but that universal man wrote\\nby his pen a confession true for one and true for all. His own secret biography\\nhe finds in lines wonderfully intelligible to him, dotted down before he was\\nborn. One after another he comes up in his private adventures with every fable\\nof Æsop, of Homer, of Hafiz, of Ariosto, of Chaucer, of Scott, and verifies\\nthem with his own head and hands.', 'The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper creations of the imagination\\nand not of the fancy, are universal verities. What a range of meanings and what\\nperpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus! Beside its primary value as\\nthe first chapter of the history of Europe, (the mythology thinly veiling\\nauthentic facts, the invention of the mechanic arts and the migration of\\ncolonies,) it gives the history of religion, with some closeness to the faith\\nof later ages. Prometheus is the Jesus of the old mythology. He is the friend\\nof man; stands between the unjust “justice” of the Eternal Father\\nand the race of mortals, and readily suffers all things on their account. But\\nwhere it departs from the Calvinistic Christianity and exhibits him as the\\ndefier of Jove, it represents a state of mind which readily appears wherever\\nthe doctrine of Theism is taught in a crude, objective form, and which seems\\nthe self-defence of man against this untruth, namely a discontent with the\\nbelieved fact that a God exists, and a feeling that the obligation of reverence\\nis onerous. It would steal if it could the fire of the Creator, and live apart\\nfrom him and independent of him. The Prometheus Vinctus is the romance of\\nskepticism. Not less true to all time are the details of that stately apologue.\\nApollo kept the flocks of Admetus, said the poets. When the gods come among\\nmen, they are not known. Jesus was not; Socrates and Shakspeare were not.\\nAntaeus was suffocated by the gripe of Hercules, but every time he touched his\\nmother earth his strength was renewed. Man is the broken giant, and in all his\\nweakness both his body and his mind are invigorated by habits of conversation\\nwith nature. The power of music, the power of poetry, to unfix and as it were\\nclap wings to solid nature, interprets the riddle of Orpheus. The philosophical\\nperception of identity through endless mutations of form makes him know the\\nProteus. What else am I who laughed or wept yesterday, who slept last night\\nlike a corpse, and this morning stood and ran? And what see I on any side but\\nthe transmigrations of Proteus? I can symbolize my thought by using the name of\\nany creature, of any fact, because every creature is man agent or patient.\\nTantalus is but a name for you and me. Tantalus means the impossibility of\\ndrinking the waters of thought which are always gleaming and waving within\\nsight of the soul. The transmigration of souls is no fable. I would it were;\\nbut men and women are only half human. Every animal of the barn-yard, the field\\nand the forest, of the earth and of the waters that are under the earth, has\\ncontrived to get a footing and to leave the print of its features and form in\\nsome one or other of these upright, heaven-facing speakers. Ah! brother, stop\\nthe ebb of thy soul,—ebbing downward into the forms into whose habits\\nthou hast now for many years slid. As near and proper to us is also that old\\nfable of the Sphinx, who was said to sit in the road-side and put riddles to\\nevery passenger. If the man could not answer, she swallowed him alive. If he\\ncould solve the riddle, the Sphinx was slain. What is our life but an endless\\nflight of winged facts or events? In splendid variety these changes come, all\\nputting questions to the human spirit. Those men who cannot answer by a\\nsuperior wisdom these facts or questions of time, serve them. Facts encumber\\nthem, tyrannize over them, and make the men of routine, the men of\\nsense, in whom a literal obedience to facts has extinguished every spark\\nof that light by which man is truly man. But if the man is true to his better\\ninstincts or sentiments, and refuses the dominion of facts, as one that comes\\nof a higher race; remains fast by the soul and sees the principle, then the\\nfacts fall aptly and supple into their places; they know their master, and the\\nmeanest of them glorifies him.', 'See in Goethe’s Helena the same desire that every word should be a thing.\\nThese figures, he would say, these Chirons, Griffins, Phorkyas, Helen and Leda,\\nare somewhat, and do exert a specific influence on the mind. So far then are\\nthey eternal entities, as real to-day as in the first Olympiad. Much revolving\\nthem he writes out freely his humor, and gives them body to his own\\nimagination. And although that poem be as vague and fantastic as a dream, yet\\nis it much more attractive than the more regular dramatic pieces of the same\\nauthor, for the reason that it operates a wonderful relief to the mind from the\\nroutine of customary images,—awakens the reader’s invention and\\nfancy by the wild freedom of the design, and by the unceasing succession of\\nbrisk shocks of surprise.', 'The universal nature, too strong for the petty nature of the bard, sits on his\\nneck and writes through his hand; so that when he seems to vent a mere caprice\\nand wild romance, the issue is an exact allegory. Hence Plato said that\\n“poets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves\\nunderstand.” All the fictions of the Middle Age explain themselves as a\\nmasked or frolic expression of that which in grave earnest the mind of that\\nperiod toiled to achieve. Magic and all that is ascribed to it is a deep\\npresentiment of the powers of science. The shoes of swiftness, the sword of\\nsharpness, the power of subduing the elements, of using the secret virtues of\\nminerals, of understanding the voices of birds, are the obscure efforts of the\\nmind in a right direction. The preternatural prowess of the hero, the gift of\\nperpetual youth, and the like, are alike the endeavour of the human spirit\\n“to bend the shows of things to the desires of the mind.”', 'In Perceforest and Amadis de Gaul a garland and a rose bloom on the head of her\\nwho is faithful, and fade on the brow of the inconstant.

I read the Bride of Lammermoor. Sir\\nWilliam Ashton is a mask for a vulgar temptation, Ravenswood Castle a fine name\\nfor proud poverty, and the foreign mission of state only a Bunyan disguise for\\nhonest industry. We may all shoot a wild bull that would toss the good and\\nbeautiful, by fighting down the unjust and sensual. Lucy Ashton is another name\\nfor fidelity, which is always beautiful and always liable to calamity in this\\nworld.', 'But along with the civil and metaphysical history of man, another history goes\\ndaily forward,—that of the external world,—in which he is not less\\nstrictly implicated. He is the compend of time; he is also the correlative of\\nnature. His power consists in the multitude of his affinities, in the fact that\\nhis life is intertwined with the whole chain of organic and inorganic being. In\\nold Rome the public roads beginning at the Forum proceeded north, south, east,\\nwest, to the centre of every province of the empire, making each market-town of\\nPersia, Spain and Britain pervious to the soldiers of the capital: so out of\\nthe human heart go as it were highways to the heart of every object in nature,\\nto reduce it under the dominion of man.

If an angry bigot assumes this bountiful\\ncause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from Barbadoes, why\\nshould I not say to him, ‘Go love thy infant; love thy wood-chopper; be\\ngood-natured and modest; have that grace; and never varnish your hard,\\nuncharitable ambition with this incredible tenderness for black folk a thousand\\nmiles off. Thy love afar is spite at home.’ Rough and graceless would be\\nsuch greeting, but truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your\\ngoodness must have some edge to it,—else it is none. The doctrine of\\nhatred must be preached, as the counteraction of the doctrine of love, when\\nthat pules and whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my\\ngenius calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, Whim. I\\nhope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the day in\\nexplanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I exclude company.\\nThen again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day, of my obligation to put\\nall poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee thou\\nfoolish philanthropist that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent, I give to\\nsuch men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong. There is a class\\nof persons to whom by all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I\\nwill go to prison if need be; but your miscellaneous popular charities; the\\neducation at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the vain end\\nto which many now stand; alms to sots, and the thousand-fold Relief\\nSocieties;—though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and give the\\ndollar, it is a wicked dollar which by and by I shall have the manhood to\\nwithhold.', 'Virtues are, in the popular estimate, rather the exception than the rule. There\\nis the man and his virtues. Men do what is called a good action, as some\\npiece of courage or charity, much as they would pay a fine in expiation of\\ndaily non-appearance on parade. Their works are done as an apology or\\nextenuation of their living in the world,—as invalids and the insane pay\\na high board. Their virtues are penances. I do not wish to expiate, but to\\nlive. My life is for itself and not for a spectacle. I much prefer that it\\nshould be of a lower strain, so it be genuine and equal, than that it should be\\nglittering and unsteady. I wish it to be sound and sweet, and not to need diet\\nand bleeding. I ask primary evidence that you are a man, and refuse this appeal\\nfrom the man to his actions. I know that for myself it makes no difference\\nwhether I do or forbear those actions which are reckoned excellent. I cannot\\nconsent to pay for a privilege where I have intrinsic right. Few and mean as my\\ngifts may be, I actually am, and do not need for my own assurance or the\\nassurance of my fellows any secondary testimony.', 'What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think. This rule,\\nequally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may serve for the whole\\ndistinction between greatness and meanness. It is the harder because you will\\nalways find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know\\nit. It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy\\nin solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of\\nthe crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.', 'The objection to conforming to usages that have become dead to you is that it\\nscatters your force. It loses your time and blurs the impression of your\\ncharacter. If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible-society,\\nvote with a great party either for the government or against it, spread your\\ntable like base housekeepers,—under all these screens I have difficulty\\nto detect the precise man you are: and of course so much force is withdrawn\\nfrom your proper life. But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work,\\nand you shall reinforce yourself. A man must consider what a\\nblindman’s-buff is this game of conformity. If I know your sect, I\\nanticipate your argument. I hear a preacher announce for his text and topic the\\nexpediency of one of the institutions of his church. Do I not know beforehand\\nthat not possibly can he say a new and spontaneous word? Do I not know that\\nwith all this ostentation of examining the grounds of the institution he will\\ndo no such thing? Do I not know that he is pledged to himself not to look but\\nat one side, the permitted side, not as a man, but as a parish minister? He is\\na retained attorney, and these airs of the bench are the emptiest affectation.\\nWell, most men have bound their eyes with one or another handkerchief, and\\nattached themselves to some one of these communities of opinion. This\\nconformity makes them not false in a few particulars, authors of a few lies,\\nbut false in all particulars. Their every truth is not quite true. Their two is\\nnot the real two, their four not the real four; so that every word they say\\nchagrins us and we know not where to begin to set them right. Meantime nature\\nis not slow to equip us in the prison-uniform of the party to which we adhere.\\nWe come to wear one cut of face and figure, and acquire by degrees the gentlest\\nasinine expression. There is a mortifying experience in particular, which does\\nnot fail to wreak itself also in the general history; I mean “the foolish\\nface of praise,” the forced smile which we put on in company where we do\\nnot feel at ease in answer to conversation which does not interest us. The\\nmuscles, not spontaneously moved but moved by a low usurping wilfulness, grow\\ntight about the outline of the face with the most disagreeable sensation.', 'For nonconformity the world whips you with its displeasure. And therefore a man\\nmust know how to estimate a sour face. The by-standers look askance on him in\\nthe public street or in the friend’s parlor. If this aversation had its\\norigin in contempt and resistance like his own he might well go home with a sad\\ncountenance; but the sour faces of the multitude, like their sweet faces, have\\nno deep cause, but are put on and off as the wind blows and a newspaper\\ndirects. Yet is the discontent of the multitude more formidable than that of\\nthe senate and the college. It is easy enough for a firm man who knows the\\nworld to brook the rage of the cultivated classes. Their rage is decorous and\\nprudent, for they are timid, as being very vulnerable themselves. But when to\\ntheir feminine rage the indignation of the people is added, when the ignorant\\nand the poor are aroused, when the unintelligent brute force that lies at the\\nbottom of society is made to growl and mow, it needs the habit of magnanimity\\nand religion to treat it godlike as a trifle of no concernment.', 'The other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence\\nfor our past act or word because the eyes of others have no other data for\\ncomputing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.', 'But why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this\\ncorpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or\\nthat public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems\\nto be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in\\nacts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed\\npresent, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied\\npersonality to the Deity, yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield\\nto them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color.\\nLeave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.', 'A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little\\nstatesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has\\nsimply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the\\nwall. Speak what you think now in hard words and to-morrow speak what to-morrow\\nthinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said\\nto-day.—‘Ah, so you shall be sure to be\\nmisunderstood.’—Is it so bad then to be misunderstood? Pythagoras\\nwas misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and\\nGalileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be\\ngreat is to be misunderstood.', 'I suppose no man can violate his nature. All the sallies of his will are\\nrounded in by the law of his being, as the inequalities of Andes and Himmaleh\\nare insignificant in the curve of the sphere. Nor does it matter how you gauge\\nand try him. A character is like an acrostic or Alexandrian stanza;—read\\nit forward, backward, or across, it still spells the same thing. In this\\npleasing contrite wood-life which God allows me, let me record day by day my\\nhonest thought without prospect or retrospect, and, I cannot doubt, it will be\\nfound symmetrical, though I mean it not and see it not. My book should smell of\\npines and resound with the hum of insects. The swallow over my window should\\ninterweave that thread or straw he carries in his bill into my web also. We\\npass for what we are. Character teaches above our wills. Men imagine that they\\ncommunicate their virtue or vice only by overt actions, and do not see that\\nvirtue or vice emit a breath every moment.', 'There will be an agreement in whatever variety of actions, so they be each\\nhonest and natural in their hour. For of one will, the actions will be\\nharmonious, however unlike they seem. These varieties are lost sight of at a\\nlittle distance, at a little height of thought. One tendency unites them all.\\nThe voyage of the best ship is a zigzag line of a hundred tacks. See the line\\nfrom a sufficient distance, and it straightens itself to the average tendency.\\nYour genuine action will explain itself and will explain your other genuine\\nactions. Your conformity explains nothing. Act singly, and what you have\\nalready done singly will justify you now. Greatness appeals to the future. If I\\ncan be firm enough to-day to do right and scorn eyes, I must have done so much\\nright before as to defend me now. Be it how it will, do right now. Always scorn\\nappearances and you always may. The force of character is cumulative. All the\\nforegone days of virtue work their health into this. What makes the majesty of\\nthe heroes of the senate and the field, which so fills the imagination? The\\nconsciousness of a train of great days and victories behind. They shed an\\nunited light on the advancing actor. He is attended as by a visible escort of\\nangels. That is it which throws thunder into Chatham’s voice, and dignity\\ninto Washington’s port, and America into Adams’s eye. Honor is\\nvenerable to us because it is no ephemera. It is always ancient virtue. We\\nworship it to-day because it is not of to-day. We love it and pay it homage\\nbecause it is not a trap for our love and homage, but is self-dependent,\\nself-derived, and therefore of an old immaculate pedigree, even if shown in a\\nyoung person.', 'I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. Let\\nthe words be gazetted and ridiculous henceforward. Instead of the gong for\\ndinner, let us hear a whistle from the Spartan fife. Let us never bow and\\napologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to\\nplease him; I wish that he should wish to please me. I will stand here for\\nhumanity, and though I would make it kind, I would make it true. Let us affront\\nand reprimand the smooth mediocrity and squalid contentment of the times, and\\nhurl in the face of custom and trade and office, the fact which is the upshot\\nof all history, that there is a great responsible Thinker and Actor working\\nwherever a man works; that a true man belongs to no other time or place, but is\\nthe centre of things. Where he is, there is nature. He measures you and all men\\nand all events. Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else,\\nor of some other person. Character, reality, reminds you of nothing else; it\\ntakes place of the whole creation. The man must be so much that he must make\\nall circumstances indifferent. Every true man is a cause, a country, and an\\nage; requires infinite spaces and numbers and time fully to accomplish his\\ndesign;—and posterity seem to follow his steps as a train of clients. A\\nman Cæsar is born, and for ages after we have a Roman Empire. Christ is born,\\nand millions of minds so grow and cleave to his genius that he is confounded\\nwith virtue and the possible of man. An institution is the lengthened shadow of\\none man; as, Monachism, of the Hermit Antony; the Reformation, of Luther;\\nQuakerism, of Fox; Methodism, of Wesley; Abolition, of Clarkson. Scipio, Milton\\ncalled “the height of Rome”; and all history resolves itself very\\neasily into the biography of a few stout and earnest persons.', 'Let a man then know his worth, and keep things under his feet. Let him not peep\\nor steal, or skulk up and down with the air of a charity-boy, a bastard, or an\\ninterloper in the world which exists for him. But the man in the street,\\nfinding no worth in himself which corresponds to the force which built a tower\\nor sculptured a marble god, feels poor when he looks on these. To him a palace,\\na statue, or a costly book have an alien and forbidding air, much like a gay\\nequipage, and seem to say like that, ‘Who are you, Sir?’ Yet they\\nall are his, suitors for his notice, petitioners to his faculties that they\\nwill come out and take possession. The picture waits for my verdict; it is not\\nto command me, but I am to settle its claims to praise. That popular fable of\\nthe sot who was picked up dead drunk in the street, carried to the duke’s\\nhouse, washed and dressed and laid in the duke’s bed, and, on his waking,\\ntreated with all obsequious ceremony like the duke, and assured that he had\\nbeen insane, owes its popularity to the fact that it symbolizes so well the\\nstate of man, who is in the world a sort of sot, but now and then wakes up,\\nexercises his reason and finds himself a true prince.', 'Our reading is mendicant and sycophantic. In history our imagination plays us\\nfalse. Kingdom and lordship, power and estate, are a gaudier vocabulary than\\nprivate John and Edward in a small house and common day’s work; but the\\nthings of life are the same to both; the sum total of both is the same. Why all\\nthis deference to Alfred and Scanderbeg and Gustavus? Suppose they were\\nvirtuous; did they wear out virtue? As great a stake depends on your private\\nact to-day, as followed their public and renowned steps. When private men shall\\nact with original views, the lustre will be transferred from the actions of\\nkings to those of gentlemen.', 'The world has been instructed by its kings, who have so magnetized the eyes of\\nnations. It has been taught by this colossal symbol the mutual reverence that\\nis due from man to man. The joyful loyalty with which men have everywhere\\nsuffered the king, the noble, or the great proprietor to walk among them by a\\nlaw of his own, make his own scale of men and things and reverse theirs, pay\\nfor benefits not with money but with honor, and represent the law in his\\nperson, was the hieroglyphic by which they obscurely signified their\\nconsciousness of their own right and comeliness, the right of every man.', 'The magnetism which all original action exerts is explained when we inquire the\\nreason of self-trust. Who is the Trustee? What is the aboriginal Self, on which\\na universal reliance may be grounded? What is the nature and power of that\\nscience-baffling star, without parallax, without calculable elements, which\\nshoots a ray of beauty even into trivial and impure actions, if the least mark\\nof independence appear? The inquiry leads us to that source, at once the\\nessence of genius, of virtue, and of life, which we call Spontaneity or\\nInstinct. We denote this primary wisdom as Intuition, whilst all later\\nteachings are tuitions. In that deep force, the last fact behind which analysis\\ncannot go, all things find their common origin. For the sense of being which in\\ncalm hours rises, we know not how, in the soul, is not diverse from things,\\nfrom space, from light, from time, from man, but one with them and proceeds\\nobviously from the same source whence their life and being also proceed. We\\nfirst share the life by which things exist and afterwards see them as\\nappearances in nature and forget that we have shared their cause. Here is the\\nfountain of action and of thought. Here are the lungs of that inspiration which\\ngiveth man wisdom and which cannot be denied without impiety and atheism. We\\nlie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its truth\\nand organs of its activity. When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we\\ndo nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams. If we ask whence\\nthis comes, if we seek to pry into the soul that causes, all philosophy is at\\nfault. Its presence or its absence is all we can affirm. Every man\\ndiscriminates between the voluntary acts of his mind and his involuntary\\nperceptions, and knows that to his involuntary perceptions a perfect faith is\\ndue. He may err in the expression of them, but he knows that these things are\\nso, like day and night, not to be disputed. My wilful actions and acquisitions\\nare but roving;—the idlest reverie, the faintest native emotion, command\\nmy curiosity and respect. Thoughtless people contradict as readily the\\nstatement of perceptions as of opinions, or rather much more readily; for they\\ndo not distinguish between perception and notion. They fancy that I choose to\\nsee this or that thing. But perception is not whimsical, but fatal. If I see a\\ntrait, my children will see it after me, and in course of time all\\nmankind,—although it may chance that no one has seen it before me. For my\\nperception of it is as much a fact as the sun.', 'The relations of the soul to the divine spirit are so pure that it is profane\\nto seek to interpose helps. It must be that when God speaketh he should\\ncommunicate, not one thing, but all things; should fill the world with his\\nvoice; should scatter forth light, nature, time, souls, from the centre of the\\npresent thought; and new date and new create the whole. Whenever a mind is\\nsimple and receives a divine wisdom, old things pass away,—means,\\nteachers, texts, temples fall; it lives now, and absorbs past and future into\\nthe present hour. All things are made sacred by relation to it,—one as\\nmuch as another. All things are dissolved to their centre by their cause, and\\nin the universal miracle petty and particular miracles disappear. If therefore\\na man claims to know and speak of God and carries you backward to the\\nphraseology of some old mouldered nation in another country, in another world,\\nbelieve him not. Is the acorn better than the oak which is its fulness and\\ncompletion? Is the parent better than the child into whom he has cast his\\nripened being? Whence then this worship of the past? The centuries are\\nconspirators against the sanity and authority of the soul. Time and space are\\nbut physiological colors which the eye makes, but the soul is light: where it\\nis, is day; where it was, is night; and history is an impertinence and an\\ninjury if it be any thing more than a cheerful apologue or parable of my being\\nand becoming.', 'Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say ‘I\\nthink,’ ‘I am,’ but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed\\nbefore the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make\\nno reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are;\\nthey exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose;\\nit is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst,\\nits whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless\\nroot there is no less. Its nature is satisfied and it satisfies nature in all\\nmoments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present,\\nbut with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that\\nsurround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and\\nstrong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.', 'This should be plain enough. Yet see what strong intellects dare not yet hear\\nGod himself unless he speak the phraseology of I know not what David, or\\nJeremiah, or Paul. We shall not always set so great a price on a few texts, on\\na few lives. We are like children who repeat by rote the sentences of grandames\\nand tutors, and, as they grow older, of the men of talents and character they\\nchance to see,—painfully recollecting the exact words they spoke;\\nafterwards, when they come into the point of view which those had who uttered\\nthese sayings, they understand them and are willing to let the words go; for at\\nany time they can use words as good when occasion comes. If we live truly, we\\nshall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as it is for\\nthe weak to be weak. When we have new perception, we shall gladly disburden the\\nmemory of its hoarded treasures as old rubbish. When a man lives with God, his\\nvoice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the brook and the rustle of the corn.', 'And now at last the highest truth on this subject remains unsaid; probably\\ncannot be said; for all that we say is the far-off remembering of the\\nintuition. That thought by what I can now nearest approach to say it, is this.\\nWhen good is near you, when you have life in yourself, it is not by any known\\nor accustomed way; you shall not discern the footprints of any other; you shall\\nnot see the face of man; you shall not hear any name;—the way, the\\nthought, the good shall be wholly strange and new. It shall exclude example and\\nexperience. You take the way from man, not to man. All persons that ever\\nexisted are its forgotten ministers. Fear and hope are alike beneath it. There\\nis somewhat low even in hope. In the hour of vision there is nothing that can\\nbe called gratitude, nor properly joy. The soul raised over passion beholds\\nidentity and eternal causation, perceives the self-existence of Truth and\\nRight, and calms itself with knowing that all things go well. Vast spaces of\\nnature, the Atlantic Ocean, the South Sea; long intervals of time, years,\\ncenturies, are of no account. This which I think and feel underlay every former\\nstate of life and circumstances, as it does underlie my present, and what is\\ncalled life, and what is called death.', 'Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose;\\nit resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the\\nshooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. This one fact the world hates;\\nthat the soul becomes; for that for ever degrades the past, turns all\\nriches to poverty, all reputation to a shame, confounds the saint with the\\nrogue, shoves Jesus and Judas equally aside. Why then do we prate of\\nself-reliance? Inasmuch as the soul is present there will be power not\\nconfident but agent. To talk of reliance is a poor external way of speaking.\\nSpeak rather of that which relies because it works and is. Who has more\\nobedience than I masters me, though he should not raise his finger. Round him I\\nmust revolve by the gravitation of spirits. We fancy it rhetoric when we speak\\nof eminent virtue. We do not yet see that virtue is Height, and that a man or a\\ncompany of men, plastic and permeable to principles, by the law of nature must\\noverpower and ride all cities, nations, kings, rich men, poets, who are not.', 'This is the ultimate fact which we so quickly reach on this, as on every topic,\\nthe resolution of all into the ever-blessed ONE. Self-existence\\nis the attribute of the Supreme Cause, and it constitutes the measure of good\\nby the degree in which it enters into all lower forms. All things real are so\\nby so much virtue as they contain. Commerce, husbandry, hunting, whaling, war,\\neloquence, personal weight, are somewhat, and engage my respect as examples of\\nits presence and impure action. I see the same law working in nature for\\nconservation and growth. Power is, in nature, the essential measure of right.\\nNature suffers nothing to remain in her kingdoms which cannot help itself. The\\ngenesis and maturation of a planet, its poise and orbit, the bended tree\\nrecovering itself from the strong wind, the vital resources of every animal and\\nvegetable, are demonstrations of the self-sufficing and therefore self-relying\\nsoul.', 'Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the cause. Let\\nus stun and astonish the intruding rabble of men and books and institutions, by\\na simple declaration of the divine fact.

Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius\\nadmonished to stay at home, to put itself in communication with the internal\\nocean, but it goes abroad to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men.

Not for that will I adopt their petulance or folly, even\\nto the extent of being ashamed of it. But your isolation must not be\\nmechanical, but spiritual, that is, must be elevation.

Prayer looks abroad and asks for some\\nforeign addition to come through some foreign virtue, and loses itself in\\nendless mazes of natural and supernatural, and mediatorial and miraculous.\\nPrayer that craves a particular commodity, any thing less than all good, is\\nvicious. Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest\\npoint of view. It is the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the\\nspirit of God pronouncing his works good. But prayer as a means to effect a\\nprivate end is meanness and theft. It supposes dualism and not unity in nature\\nand consciousness. As soon as the man is at one with God, he will not beg. He\\nwill then see prayer in all action. The prayer of the farmer kneeling in his\\nfield to weed it, the prayer of the rower kneeling with the stroke of his oar,\\nare true prayers heard throughout nature, though for cheap ends. Caratach, in\\nFletcher’s Bonduca, when admonished to inquire the mind of the god\\nAudate, replies,—', '“His hidden meaning lies in our endeavors;\\nOur valors are our best gods.”', 'Another sort of false prayers are our regrets. Discontent is the want of\\nself-reliance: it is infirmity of will. Regret calamities if you can thereby\\nhelp the sufferer; if not, attend your own work and already the evil begins to\\nbe repaired. Our sympathy is just as base. We come to them who weep foolishly\\nand sit down and cry for company, instead of imparting to them truth and health\\nin rough electric shocks, putting them once more in communication with their\\nown reason. The secret of fortune is joy in our hands. Welcome evermore to gods\\nand men is the self-helping man. For him all doors are flung wide; him all\\ntongues greet, all honors crown, all eyes follow with desire. Our love goes out\\nto him and embraces him because he did not need it. We solicitously and\\napologetically caress and celebrate him because he held on his way and scorned\\nour disapprobation. The gods love him because men hated him. “To the\\npersevering mortal,” said Zoroaster, “the blessed Immortals are\\nswift.”', 'As men’s prayers are a disease of the will, so are their creeds a disease\\nof the intellect. They say with those foolish Israelites, ‘Let not God\\nspeak to us, lest we die. Speak thou, speak any man with us, and we will\\nobey.’ Everywhere I am hindered of meeting God in my brother, because he\\nhas shut his own temple doors and recites fables merely of his brother’s,\\nor his brother’s brother’s God. Every new mind is a new\\nclassification. If it prove a mind of uncommon activity and power, a Locke, a\\nLavoisier, a Hutton, a Bentham, a Fourier, it imposes its classification on\\nother men, and lo! a new system. In proportion to the depth of the thought, and\\nso to the number of the objects it touches and brings within reach of the\\npupil, is his complacency. But chiefly is this apparent in creeds and churches,\\nwhich are also classifications of some powerful mind acting on the elemental\\nthought of duty, and man’s relation to the Highest. Such is Calvinism,\\nQuakerism, Swedenborgism. The pupil takes the same delight in subordinating\\nevery thing to the new terminology as a girl who has just learned botany in\\nseeing a new earth and new seasons thereby. It will happen for a time that the\\npupil will find his intellectual power has grown by the study of his\\nmaster’s mind. But in all unbalanced minds the classification is\\nidolized, passes for the end and not for a speedily exhaustible means, so that\\nthe walls of the system blend to their eye in the remote horizon with the walls\\nof the universe; the luminaries of heaven seem to them hung on the arch their\\nmaster built. They cannot imagine how you aliens have any right to\\nsee,—how you can see; ‘It must be somehow that you stole the light\\nfrom us.’ They do not yet perceive that light, unsystematic, indomitable,\\nwill break into any cabin, even into theirs. Let them chirp awhile and call it\\ntheir own. If they are honest and do well, presently their neat new pinfold\\nwill be too strait and low, will crack, will lean, will rot and vanish, and the\\nimmortal light, all young and joyful, million-orbed, million-colored, will beam\\nover the universe as on the first morning.', '2. It is for want of self-culture that the superstition of Travelling, whose\\nidols are Italy, England, Egypt, retains its fascination for all educated\\nAmericans. They who made England, Italy, or Greece venerable in the imagination\\ndid so by sticking fast where they were, like an axis of the earth. In manly\\nhours we feel that duty is our place. The soul is no traveller; the wise man\\nstays at home, and when his necessities, his duties, on any occasion call him\\nfrom his house, or into foreign lands, he is at home still and shall make men\\nsensible by the expression of his countenance that he goes, the missionary of\\nwisdom and virtue, and visits cities and men like a sovereign and not like an\\ninterloper or a valet.', 'I have no churlish objection to the circumnavigation of the globe for the\\npurposes of art, of study, and benevolence, so that the man is first\\ndomesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding somewhat greater\\nthan he knows. He who travels to be amused, or to get somewhat which he does\\nnot carry, travels away from himself, and grows old even in youth among old\\nthings. In Thebes, in Palmyra, his will and mind have become old and\\ndilapidated as they. He carries ruins to ruins.', 'Travelling is a fool’s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the\\nindifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be\\nintoxicated with beauty and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my\\nfriends, embark on the sea and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me\\nis the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I\\nseek the Vatican and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and\\nsuggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.', '3. But the rage of travelling is a symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting\\nthe whole intellectual action. The intellect is vagabond, and our system of\\neducation fosters restlessness. Our minds travel when our bodies are forced to\\nstay at home. We imitate; and what is imitation but the travelling of the mind?\\nOur houses are built with foreign taste; our shelves are garnished with foreign\\nornaments; our opinions, our tastes, our faculties, lean, and follow the Past\\nand the Distant. The soul created the arts wherever they have flourished. It\\nwas in his own mind that the artist sought his model. It was an application of\\nhis own thought to the thing to be done and the conditions to be observed. And\\nwhy need we copy the Doric or the Gothic model? Beauty, convenience, grandeur\\nof thought and quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the\\nAmerican artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done by\\nhim, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day, the wants of the\\npeople, the habit and form of the government, he will create a house in which\\nall these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be\\nsatisfied also.', 'Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift you can present every moment\\nwith the cumulative force of a whole life’s cultivation; but of the\\nadopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous half possession. That\\nwhich each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No man yet knows what\\nit is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is the master who\\ncould have taught Shakspeare? Where is the master who could have instructed\\nFranklin, or Washington, or Bacon, or Newton? Every great man is a unique. The\\nScipionism of Scipio is precisely that part he could not borrow. Shakspeare\\nwill never be made by the study of Shakspeare. Do that which is assigned you,\\nand you cannot hope too much or dare too much. There is at this moment for you\\nan utterance brave and grand as that of the colossal chisel of Phidias, or\\ntrowel of the Egyptians, or the pen of Moses or Dante, but different from all\\nthese. Not possibly will the soul, all rich, all eloquent, with thousand-cloven\\ntongue, deign to repeat itself; but if you can hear what these patriarchs say,\\nsurely you can reply to them in the same pitch of voice; for the ear and the\\ntongue are two organs of one nature. Abide in the simple and noble regions of\\nthy life, obey thy heart and thou shalt reproduce the Foreworld again.', '4. As our Religion, our Education, our Art look abroad, so does our spirit of\\nsociety. All men plume themselves on the improvement of society, and no man\\nimproves.', 'Society never advances. It recedes as fast on one side as it gains on the\\nother. It undergoes continual changes; it is barbarous, it is civilized, it is\\nchristianized, it is rich, it is scientific; but this change is not\\namelioration. For every thing that is given something is taken. Society\\nacquires new arts and loses old instincts. What a contrast between the\\nwell-clad, reading, writing, thinking American, with a watch, a pencil and a\\nbill of exchange in his pocket, and the naked New Zealander, whose property is\\na club, a spear, a mat and an undivided twentieth of a shed to sleep under! But\\ncompare the health of the two men and you shall see that the white man has lost\\nhis aboriginal strength.

The solstice\\nhe does not observe; the equinox he knows as little; and the whole bright\\ncalendar of the year is without a dial in his mind. His note-books impair his\\nmemory; his libraries overload his wit; the insurance-office increases the\\nnumber of accidents; and it may be a question whether machinery does not\\nencumber; whether we have not lost by refinement some energy, by a Christianity\\nentrenched in establishments and forms some vigor of wild virtue. For every\\nStoic was a Stoic; but in Christendom where is the Christian?', 'There is no more deviation in the moral standard than in the standard of height\\nor bulk. No greater men are now than ever were. A singular equality may be\\nobserved between the great men of the first and of the last ages; nor can all\\nthe science, art, religion, and philosophy of the nineteenth century avail to\\neducate greater men than Plutarch’s heroes, three or four and twenty\\ncenturies ago. Not in time is the race progressive. Phocion, Socrates,\\nAnaxagoras, Diogenes, are great men, but they leave no class. He who is really\\nof their class will not be called by their name, but will be his own man, and\\nin his turn the founder of a sect. The arts and inventions of each period are\\nonly its costume and do not invigorate men. The harm of the improved machinery\\nmay compensate its good. Hudson and Behring accomplished so much in their\\nfishing-boats as to astonish Parry and Franklin, whose equipment exhausted the\\nresources of science and art. Galileo, with an opera-glass, discovered a more\\nsplendid series of celestial phenomena than any one since. Columbus found the\\nNew World in an undecked boat. It is curious to see the periodical disuse and\\nperishing of means and machinery which were introduced with loud laudation a\\nfew years or centuries before. The great genius returns to essential man. We\\nreckoned the improvements of the art of war among the triumphs of science, and\\nyet Napoleon conquered Europe by the bivouac, which consisted of falling back\\non naked valor and disencumbering it of all aids. The Emperor held it\\nimpossible to make a perfect army, says Las Cases, “without abolishing\\nour arms, magazines, commissaries and carriages, until, in imitation of the\\nRoman custom, the soldier should receive his supply of corn, grind it in his\\nhand-mill, and bake his bread himself.”', 'Society is a wave. The wave moves onward, but the water of which it is composed\\ndoes not. The same particle does not rise from the valley to the ridge. Its\\nunity is only phenomenal.

Men have looked away from themselves\\nand at things so long that they have come to esteem the religious, learned and\\ncivil institutions as guards of property, and they deprecate assaults on these,\\nbecause they feel them to be assaults on property. They measure their esteem of\\neach other by what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man\\nbecomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature. Especially\\nhe hates what he has if he see that it is accidental,—came to him by\\ninheritance, or gift, or crime; then he feels that it is not having; it does\\nnot belong to him, has no root in him and merely lies there because no\\nrevolution or no robber takes it away. But that which a man is, does always by\\nnecessity acquire, and what the man acquires is living property, which does not\\nwait the beck of rulers, or mobs, or revolutions, or fire, or storm, or\\nbankruptcies, but perpetually renews itself wherever the man breathes.\\n“Thy lot or portion of life,” said the Caliph Ali, “is\\nseeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it.” Our\\ndependence on these foreign goods leads us to our slavish respect for numbers.\\nThe political parties meet in numerous conventions; the greater the concourse\\nand with each new uproar of announcement, The delegation from Essex!

The documents too from\\nwhich the doctrine is to be drawn, charmed my fancy by their endless variety,\\nand lay always before me, even in sleep; for they are the tools in our hands,\\nthe bread in our basket, the transactions of the street, the farm and the\\ndwelling-house; greetings, relations, debts and credits, the influence of\\ncharacter, the nature and endowment of all men. It seemed to me also that in it\\nmight be shown men a ray of divinity, the present action of the soul of this\\nworld, clean from all vestige of tradition; and so the heart of man might be\\nbathed by an inundation of eternal love, conversing with that which he knows\\nwas always and always must be, because it really is now. It appeared moreover\\nthat if this doctrine could be stated in terms with any resemblance to those\\nbright intuitions in which this truth is sometimes revealed to us, it would be\\na star in many dark hours and crooked passages in our journey, that would not\\nsuffer us to lose our way.', 'I was lately confirmed in these desires by hearing a sermon at church. The\\npreacher, a man esteemed for his orthodoxy, unfolded in the ordinary manner the\\ndoctrine of the Last Judgment. He assumed that judgment is not executed in this\\nworld; that the wicked are successful; that the good are miserable; and then\\nurged from reason and from Scripture a compensation to be made to both parties\\nin the next life. No offence appeared to be taken by the congregation at this\\ndoctrine. As far as I could observe when the meeting broke up they separated\\nwithout remark on the sermon.', 'Yet what was the import of this teaching? What did the preacher mean by saying\\nthat the good are miserable in the present life? Was it that houses and lands,\\noffices, wine, horses, dress, luxury, are had by unprincipled men, whilst the\\nsaints are poor and despised; and that a compensation is to be made to these\\nlast hereafter, by giving them the like gratifications another\\nday,—bank-stock and doubloons, venison and champagne? This must be the\\ncompensation intended; for what else? Is it that they are to have leave to pray\\nand praise? to love and serve men? Why, that they can do now. The legitimate\\ninference the disciple would draw was,—‘We are to have such\\na good time as the sinners have now’;—or, to push it to its extreme\\nimport,—‘You sin now; we shall sin by and by; we would sin now, if\\nwe could; not being successful, we expect our revenge to-morrow.’', 'The fallacy lay in the immense concession that the bad are successful; that\\njustice is not done now. The blindness of the preacher consisted in deferring\\nto the base estimate of the market of what constitutes a manly success, instead\\nof confronting and convicting the world from the truth; announcing the presence\\nof the soul; the omnipotence of the will; and so establishing the standard of\\ngood and ill, of success and falsehood.', 'I find a similar base tone in the popular religious works of the day and the\\nsame doctrines assumed by the literary men when occasionally they treat the\\nrelated topics. I think that our popular theology has gained in decorum, and\\nnot in principle, over the superstitions it has displaced. But men are better\\nthan their theology. Their daily life gives it the lie. Every ingenuous and\\naspiring soul leaves the doctrine behind him in his own experience, and all men\\nfeel sometimes the falsehood which they cannot demonstrate. For men are wiser\\nthan they know.

If he has\\nescaped them in form and in the appearance, it is because he has resisted his\\nlife and fled from himself, and the retribution is so much death. So signal is\\nthe failure of all attempts to make this separation of the good from the tax,\\nthat the experiment would not be tried,—since to try it is to be\\nmad,—but for the circumstance, that when the disease began in the will,\\nof rebellion and separation, the intellect is at once infected, so that the man\\nceases to see God whole in each object, but is able to see the sensual\\nallurement of an object and not see the sensual hurt; he sees the\\nmermaid’s head but not the dragon’s tail, and thinks he can cut off\\nthat which he would have from that which he would not have. “How secret\\nart thou who dwellest in the highest heavens in silence, O thou only great God,\\nsprinkling with an unwearied providence certain penal blindnesses upon such as\\nhave unbridled\\ndesires!”', 'St. Augustine, Confessions, B.

It would seem there is always this vindictive\\ncircumstance stealing in at unawares even into the wild poesy in which the\\nhuman fancy attempted to make bold holiday and to shake itself free of the old\\nlaws,—this back-stroke, this kick of the gun, certifying that the law is\\nfatal; that in nature nothing can be given, all things are sold.', 'This is that ancient doctrine of Nemesis, who keeps watch in the universe and\\nlets no offence go unchastised.

If he could communicate that secret it would instantly lose its\\nexaggerated value, blending with the daylight and the vital energy the power to\\nstand and to go.', 'The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations that our life might be much\\neasier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a happier place\\nthan it is; that there is no need of struggles, convulsions, and despairs, of\\nthe wringing of the hands and the gnashing of the teeth; that we miscreate our\\nown evils. We interfere with the optimism of nature; for whenever we get this\\nvantage-ground of the past, or of a wiser mind in the present, we are able to\\ndiscern that we are begirt with laws which execute themselves.', 'The face of external nature teaches the same lesson. Nature will not have us\\nfret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our learning much better\\nthan she likes our frauds and wars. When we come out of the caucus, or the\\nbank, or the Abolition-convention, or the Temperance-meeting, or the\\nTranscendental club into the fields and woods, she says to us, ‘So hot?\\nmy little Sir.’', 'We are full of mechanical actions. We must needs intermeddle and have things in\\nour own way, until the sacrifices and virtues of society are odious. Love\\nshould make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our Sunday-schools and\\nchurches and pauper-societies are yokes to the neck. We pain ourselves to\\nplease nobody. There are natural ways of arriving at the same ends at which\\nthese aim, but do not arrive. Why should all virtue work in one and the same\\nway? Why should all give dollars? It is very inconvenient to us country folk,\\nand we do not think any good will come of it. We have not dollars; merchants\\nhave; let them give them. Farmers will give corn; poets will sing; women will\\nsew; laborers will lend a hand; the children will bring flowers. And why drag\\nthis dead weight of a Sunday-school over the whole Christendom? It is natural\\nand beautiful that childhood should inquire and maturity should teach; but it\\nis time enough to answer questions when they are asked. Do not shut up the\\nyoung people against their will in a pew and force the children to ask them\\nquestions for an hour against their will.', 'If we look wider, things are all alike; laws and letters and creeds and modes\\nof living seem a travesty of truth. Our society is encumbered by ponderous\\nmachinery, which resembles the endless aqueducts which the Romans built over\\nhill and dale and which are superseded by the discovery of the law that water\\nrises to the level of its source. It is a Chinese wall which any nimble Tartar\\ncan leap over. It is a standing army, not so good as a peace. It is a\\ngraduated, titled, richly appointed empire, quite superfluous when\\ntown-meetings are found to answer just as well.', 'Let us draw a lesson from nature, which always works by short ways. When the\\nfruit is ripe, it falls. When the fruit is despatched, the leaf falls. The\\ncircuit of the waters is mere falling. The walking of man and all animals is a\\nfalling forward. All our manual labor and works of strength, as prying,\\nsplitting, digging, rowing and so forth, are done by dint of continual falling,\\nand the globe, earth, moon, comet, sun, star, fall for ever and ever.', 'The simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of a\\nmachine. He who sees moral nature out and out and thoroughly knows how\\nknowledge is acquired and character formed, is a pedant. The simplicity of\\nnature is not that which may easily be read, but is inexhaustible. The last\\nanalysis can no wise be made. We judge of a man’s wisdom by his hope,\\nknowing that the perception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal\\nyouth. The wild fertility of nature is felt in comparing our rigid names and\\nreputations with our fluid consciousness. We pass in the world for sects and\\nschools, for erudition and piety, and we are all the time jejune babes. One\\nsees very well how Pyrrhonism grew up. Every man sees that he is that middle\\npoint whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied with equal reason. He is\\nold, he is young, he is very wise, he is altogether ignorant. He hears and\\nfeels what you say of the seraphim, and of the tin-peddler. There is no\\npermanent wise man except in the figment of the Stoics. We side with the hero,\\nas we read or paint, against the coward and the robber; but we have been\\nourselves that coward and robber, and shall be again,—not in the low\\ncircumstance, but in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul.', 'A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us\\nthat a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful\\nlabors are unnecessary and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple,\\nspontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we\\nbecome divine. Belief and love,—a believing love will relieve us of a\\nvast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of\\nnature and over the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the\\nuniverse. It has so infused its strong enchantment into nature that we prosper\\nwhen we accept its advice, and when we struggle to wound its creatures our\\nhands are glued to our sides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of\\nthings goes to teach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of\\nus, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word. Why need you choose so\\npainfully your place and occupation and associates and modes of action and of\\nentertainment? Certainly there is a possible right for you that precludes the\\nneed of balance and wilful election. For you there is a reality, a fit place\\nand congenial duties. Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and\\nwisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled\\nto truth, to right and a perfect contentment. Then you put all gainsayers in\\nthe wrong. Then you are the world, the measure of right, of truth, of beauty.\\nIf we will not be mar-plots with our miserable interferences, the work, the\\nsociety, letters, arts, science, religion of men would go on far better than\\nnow, and the heaven predicted from the beginning of the world, and still\\npredicted from the bottom of the heart, would organize itself, as do now the\\nrose and the air and the sun.', 'I say, do not choose; but that is a figure of speech by which I would\\ndistinguish what is commonly called choice among men, and which is a\\npartial act, the choice of the hands, of the eyes, of the appetites, and not a\\nwhole act of the man. But that which I call right or goodness, is the choice of\\nmy constitution; and that which I call heaven, and inwardly aspire after, is\\nthe state or circumstance desirable to my constitution; and the action which I\\nin all my years tend to do, is the work for my faculties. We must hold a man\\namenable to reason for the choice of his daily craft or profession. It is not\\nan excuse any longer for his deeds that they are the custom of his trade. What\\nbusiness has he with an evil trade? Has he not a calling in his\\ncharacter?', 'Each man has his own vocation. The talent is the call. There is one direction\\nin which all space is open to him. He has faculties silently inviting him\\nthither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river; he runs against\\nobstructions on every side but one, on that side all obstruction is taken away\\nand he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea. This\\ntalent and this call depend on his organization, or the mode in which the\\ngeneral soul incarnates itself in him. He inclines to do something which is\\neasy to him and good when it is done, but which no other man can do. He has no\\nrival. For the more truly he consults his own powers, the more difference will\\nhis work exhibit from the work of any other. His ambition is exactly\\nproportioned to his powers. The height of the pinnacle is determined by the\\nbreadth of the base. Every man has this call of the power to do somewhat\\nunique, and no man has any other call. The pretence that he has another call, a\\nsummons by name and personal election and outward “signs that mark him\\nextraordinary, and not in the roll of common men,” is fanaticism, and\\nbetrays obtuseness to perceive that there is one mind in all the individuals,\\nand no respect of persons therein.', 'By doing his work he makes the need felt which he can supply, and creates the\\ntaste by which he is enjoyed. By doing his own work he unfolds himself. It is\\nthe vice of our public speaking that it has not abandonment. Somewhere, not\\nonly every orator but every man should let out all the length of all the reins;\\nshould find or make a frank and hearty expression of what force and meaning is\\nin him. The common experience is that the man fits himself as well as he can to\\nthe customary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as a\\ndog turns a spit. Then is he a part of the machine he moves; the man is lost.\\nUntil he can manage to communicate himself to others in his full stature and\\nproportion, he does not yet find his vocation. He must find in that an outlet\\nfor his character, so that he may justify his work to their eyes. If the labor\\nis mean, let him by his thinking and character make it liberal. Whatever he\\nknows and thinks, whatever in his apprehension is worth doing, that let him\\ncommunicate, or men will never know and honor him aright. Foolish, whenever you\\ntake the meanness and formality of that thing you do, instead of converting it\\ninto the obedient spiracle of your character and aims.', 'We like only such actions as have already long had the praise of men, and do\\nnot perceive that any thing man can do may be divinely done. We think greatness\\nentailed or organized in some places or duties, in certain offices or\\noccasions, and do not see that Paganini can extract rapture from a catgut, and\\nEulenstein from a jews-harp, and a nimble-fingered lad out of shreds of paper\\nwith his scissors, and Landseer out of swine, and the hero out of the pitiful\\nhabitation and company in which he was hidden. What we call obscure condition\\nor vulgar society is that condition and society whose poetry is not yet\\nwritten, but which you shall presently make as enviable and renowned as any. In\\nour estimates let us take a lesson from kings. The parts of hospitality, the\\nconnection of families, the impressiveness of death, and a thousand other\\nthings, royalty makes its own estimate of, and a royal mind will. To make\\nhabitually a new estimate,—that is elevation.', 'What a man does, that he has. What has he to do with hope or fear? In himself\\nis his might. Let him regard no good as solid but that which is in his nature\\nand which must grow out of him as long as he exists. The goods of fortune may\\ncome and go like summer leaves; let him scatter them on every wind as the\\nmomentary signs of his infinite productiveness.', 'He may have his own. A man’s genius, the quality that differences him\\nfrom every other, the susceptibility to one class of influences, the selection\\nof what is fit for him, the rejection of what is unfit, determines for him the\\ncharacter of the universe. A man is a method, a progressive arrangement; a\\nselecting principle, gathering his like to him wherever he goes. He takes only\\nhis own out of the multiplicity that sweeps and circles round him. He is like\\none of those booms which are set out from the shore on rivers to catch\\ndrift-wood, or like the loadstone amongst splinters of steel. Those facts,\\nwords, persons, which dwell in his memory without his being able to say why,\\nremain because they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet\\nunapprehended. They are symbols of value to him as they can interpret parts of\\nhis consciousness which he would vainly seek words for in the conventional\\nimages of books and other minds. What attracts my attention shall have it, as I\\nwill go to the man who knocks at my door, whilst a thousand persons as worthy\\ngo by it, to whom I give no regard. It is enough that these particulars speak\\nto me. A few anecdotes, a few traits of character, manners, face, a few\\nincidents, have an emphasis in your memory out of all proportion to their\\napparent significance if you measure them by the ordinary standards. They\\nrelate to your gift. Let them have their weight, and do not reject them and\\ncast about for illustration and facts more usual in literature. What your heart\\nthinks great is great. The soul’s emphasis is always right.', 'Over all things that are agreeable to his nature and genius the man has the\\nhighest right. Everywhere he may take what belongs to his spiritual estate, nor\\ncan he take any thing else though all doors were open, nor can all the force of\\nmen hinder him from taking so much. It is vain to attempt to keep a secret from\\none who has a right to know it. It will tell itself. That mood into which a\\nfriend can bring us is his dominion over us. To the thoughts of that state of\\nmind he has a right. All the secrets of that state of mind he can compel. This\\nis a law which statesmen use in practice. All the terrors of the French\\nRepublic, which held Austria in awe, were unable to command her diplomacy. But\\nNapoleon sent to Vienna M. de Narbonne, one of the old noblesse, with the\\nmorals, manners and name of that interest, saying that it was indispensable to\\nsend to the old aristocracy of Europe men of the same connection, which, in\\nfact, constitutes a sort of free-masonry. M. de Narbonne in less than a\\nfortnight penetrated all the secrets of the imperial cabinet.', 'Nothing seems so easy as to speak and to be understood.

To be sure it would be ungrateful in us not to praise them loudly.\\nThen, when all is done, a person of related mind, a brother or sister by\\nnature, comes to us so softly and easily, so nearly and intimately, as if it\\nwere the blood in our proper veins, that we feel as if some one was gone,\\ninstead of another having come; we are utterly relieved and refreshed; it is a\\nsort of joyful solitude. We foolishly think in our days of sin that we must\\ncourt friends by compliance to the customs of society, to its dress, its\\nbreeding, and its estimates.

The epochs of our life are not in\\nthe visible facts of our choice of a calling, our marriage, our acquisition of\\nan office, and the like, but in a silent thought by the way-side as we walk; in\\na thought which revises our entire manner of life and says,—‘Thus\\nhast thou done, but it were better thus.’ And all our after years, like\\nmenials, serve and wait on this, and according to their ability execute its\\nwill. This revisal or correction is a constant force, which, as a tendency,\\nreaches through our lifetime. The object of the man, the aim of these moments,\\nis to make daylight shine through him, to suffer the law to traverse his whole\\nbeing without obstruction, so that on what point soever of his doing your eye\\nfalls it shall report truly of his character, whether it be his diet, his\\nhouse, his religious forms, his society, his mirth, his vote, his opposition.\\nNow he is not homogeneous, but heterogeneous, and the ray does not traverse;\\nthere are no thorough lights, but the eye of the beholder is puzzled, detecting\\nmany unlike tendencies and a life not yet at one.', 'Why should we make it a point with our false modesty to disparage that man we\\nare and that form of being assigned to us? A good man is contented. I love and\\nhonor Epaminondas, but I do not wish to be Epaminondas. I hold it more just to\\nlove the world of this hour than the world of his hour. Nor can you, if I am\\ntrue, excite me to the least uneasiness by saying, ‘He acted and thou\\nsittest still.’ I see action to be good, when the need is, and sitting\\nstill to be also good. Epaminondas, if he was the man I take him for, would\\nhave sat still with joy and peace, if his lot had been mine. Heaven is large,\\nand affords space for all modes of love and fortitude. Why should we be\\nbusybodies and superserviceable? Action and inaction are alike to the true. One\\npiece of the tree is cut for a weathercock and one for the sleeper of a bridge;\\nthe virtue of the wood is apparent in both.', 'I desire not to disgrace the soul. The fact that I am here certainly shows me\\nthat the soul had need of an organ here. Shall I not assume the post? Shall I\\nskulk and dodge and duck with my unseasonable apologies and vain modesty and\\nimagine my being here impertinent? less pertinent than Epaminondas or Homer\\nbeing there? and that the soul did not know its own needs? Besides, without any\\nreasoning on the matter, I have no discontent. The good soul nourishes me and\\nunlocks new magazines of power and enjoyment to me every day. I will not meanly\\ndecline the immensity of good, because I have heard that it has come to others\\nin another shape.', 'Besides, why should we be cowed by the name of Action? ’Tis a trick of\\nthe senses,—no more. We know that the ancestor of every action is a\\nthought. The poor mind does not seem to itself to be any thing unless it have\\nan outside badge,—some Gentoo diet, or Quaker coat, or Calvinistic\\nprayer-meeting, or philanthropic society, or a great donation, or a high\\noffice, or, any how, some wild contrasting action to testify that it is\\nsomewhat. The rich mind lies in the sun and sleeps, and is Nature. To think is\\nto act.', 'Let us, if we must have great actions, make our own so. All action is of an\\ninfinite elasticity, and the least admits of being inflated with the celestial\\nair until it eclipses the sun and moon. Let us seek one peace by fidelity.

How\\ndare I read Washington’s campaigns when I have not answered the letters\\nof my own correspondents?

Byron says of Jack Bunting,—', '“He knew not what to say, and so he swore.”', 'I may say it of our preposterous use of books,—He knew not what to do,\\nand so he read. I can think of nothing to fill my time with, and I find\\nthe Life of Brant. It is a very extravagant compliment to pay to Brant, or to\\nGeneral Schuyler, or to General Washington. My time should be as good as their\\ntime,—my facts, my net of relations, as good as theirs, or either of\\ntheirs.

The poet\\nuses the names of Cæsar, of Tamerlane, of Bonduca, of Belisarius; the painter\\nuses the conventional story of the Virgin Mary, of Paul, of Peter.

Nature, uncontainable, flowing, forelooking, in the first\\nsentiment of kindness anticipates already a benevolence which shall lose all\\nparticular regards in its general light. The introduction to this felicity is\\nin a private and tender relation of one to one, which is the enchantment of\\nhuman life; which, like a certain divine rage and enthusiasm, seizes on man at\\none period and works a revolution in his mind and body; unites him to his race,\\npledges him to the domestic and civic relations, carries him with new sympathy\\ninto nature, enhances the power of the senses, opens the imagination, adds to\\nhis character heroic and sacred attributes, establishes marriage, and gives\\npermanence to human society.', 'The natural association of the sentiment of love with the heyday of the blood\\nseems to require that in order to portray it in vivid tints, which every youth\\nand maid should confess to be true to their throbbing experience, one must not\\nbe too old. The delicious fancies of youth reject the least savor of a mature\\nphilosophy, as chilling with age and pedantry their purple bloom. And therefore\\nI know I incur the imputation of unnecessary hardness and stoicism from those\\nwho compose the Court and Parliament of Love. But from these formidable censors\\nI shall appeal to my seniors. For it is to be considered that this passion of\\nwhich we speak, though it begin with the young, yet forsakes not the old, or\\nrather suffers no one who is truly its servant to grow old, but makes the aged\\nparticipators of it not less than the tender maiden, though in a different and\\nnobler sort. For it is a fire that kindling its first embers in the narrow nook\\nof a private bosom, caught from a wandering spark out of another private heart,\\nglows and enlarges until it warms and beams upon multitudes of men and women,\\nupon the universal heart of all, and so lights up the whole world and all\\nnature with its generous flames. It matters not therefore whether we attempt to\\ndescribe the passion at twenty, at thirty, or at eighty years. He who paints it\\nat the first period will lose some of its later, he who paints it at the last,\\nsome of its earlier traits. Only it is to be hoped that by patience and the\\nMuses’ aid we may attain to that inward view of the law which shall\\ndescribe a truth ever young and beautiful, so central that it shall commend\\nitself to the eye, at whatever angle beholden.', 'And the first condition is, that we must leave a too close and lingering\\nadherence to facts, and study the sentiment as it appeared in hope and not in\\nhistory. For each man sees his own life defaced and disfigured, as the life of\\nman is not, to his imagination. Each man sees over his own experience a certain\\nstain of error, whilst that of other men looks fair and ideal. Let any man go\\nback to those delicious relations which make the beauty of his life, which have\\ngiven him sincerest instruction and nourishment, he will shrink and moan. Alas!\\nI know not why, but infinite compunctions embitter in mature life the\\nremembrances of budding joy and cover every beloved name. Every thing is\\nbeautiful seen from the point of the intellect, or as truth. But all is sour,\\nif seen as experience. Details are melancholy; the plan is seemly and noble. In\\nthe actual world—the painful kingdom of time and place—dwell care,\\nand canker, and fear. With thought, with the ideal, is immortal hilarity, the\\nrose of joy. Round it all the Muses sing. But grief cleaves to names, and\\npersons, and the partial interests of to-day and yesterday.', 'The strong bent of nature is seen in the proportion which this topic of\\npersonal relations usurps in the conversation of society. What do we wish to\\nknow of any worthy person so much, as how he has sped in the history of this\\nsentiment? What books in the circulating libraries circulate? How we glow over\\nthese novels of passion, when the story is told with any spark of truth and\\nnature! And what fastens attention, in the intercourse of life, like any\\npassage betraying affection between two parties? Perhaps we never saw them\\nbefore, and never shall meet them again. But we see them exchange a glance, or\\nbetray a deep emotion, and we are no longer strangers. We understand them, and\\ntake the warmest interest in the development of the romance. All mankind love a\\nlover. The earliest demonstrations of complacency and kindness are\\nnature’s most winning pictures. It is the dawn of civility and grace in\\nthe coarse and rustic. The rude village boy teases the girls about the\\nschool-house door;—but to-day he comes running into the entry, and meets\\none fair child disposing her satchel; he holds her books to help her, and\\ninstantly it seems to him as if she removed herself from him infinitely, and\\nwas a sacred precinct. Among the throng of girls he runs rudely enough, but one\\nalone distances him; and these two little neighbors, that were so close just\\nnow, have learned to respect each other’s personality. Or who can avert\\nhis eyes from the engaging, half-artful, half-artless ways of school-girls who\\ngo into the country shops to buy a skein of silk or a sheet of paper, and talk\\nhalf an hour about nothing with the broad-faced, good-natured shop-boy. In the\\nvillage they are on a perfect equality, which love delights in, and without any\\ncoquetry the happy, affectionate nature of woman flows out in this pretty\\ngossip. The girls may have little beauty, yet plainly do they establish between\\nthem and the good boy the most agreeable, confiding relations, what with their\\nfun and their earnest, about Edgar and Jonas and Almira, and who was invited to\\nthe party, and who danced at the dancing-school, and when the singing-school\\nwould begin, and other nothings concerning which the parties cooed. By and by\\nthat boy wants a wife, and very truly and heartily will he know where to find a\\nsincere and sweet mate, without any risk such as Milton deplores as incident to\\nscholars and great men.', 'I have been told that in some public discourses of mine my reverence for the\\nintellect has made me unjustly cold to the personal relations. But now I almost\\nshrink at the remembrance of such disparaging words. For persons are\\nlove’s world, and the coldest philosopher cannot recount the debt of the\\nyoung soul wandering here in nature to the power of love, without being tempted\\nto unsay, as treasonable to nature, aught derogatory to the social instincts.\\nFor though the celestial rapture falling out of heaven seizes only upon those\\nof tender age, and although a beauty overpowering all analysis or comparison\\nand putting us quite beside ourselves we can seldom see after thirty years, yet\\nthe remembrance of these visions outlasts all other remembrances, and is a\\nwreath of flowers on the oldest brows. But here is a strange fact; it may seem\\nto many men, in revising their experience, that they have no fairer page in\\ntheir life’s book than the delicious memory of some passages wherein\\naffection contrived to give a witchcraft, surpassing the deep attraction of its\\nown truth, to a parcel of accidental and trivial circumstances. In looking\\nbackward they may find that several things which were not the charm have more\\nreality to this groping memory than the charm itself which embalmed them. But\\nbe our experience in particulars what it may, no man ever forgot the\\nvisitations of that power to his heart and brain, which created all things\\nanew; which was the dawn in him of music, poetry, and art; which made the face\\nof nature radiant with purple light, the morning and the night varied\\nenchantments; when a single tone of one voice could make the heart bound, and\\nthe most trivial circumstance associated with one form is put in the amber of\\nmemory; when he became all eye when one was present, and all memory when one\\nwas gone; when the youth becomes a watcher of windows and studious of a glove,\\na veil, a ribbon, or the wheels of a carriage; when no place is too solitary\\nand none too silent, for him who has richer company and sweeter conversation in\\nhis new thoughts than any old friends, though best and purest, can give him;\\nfor the figures, the motions, the words of the beloved object are not like\\nother images written in water, but, as Plutarch said, “enamelled in\\nfire,” and make the study of midnight:—', '“Thou art not gone being gone, where’er thou art,\\nThou leav’st in him thy watchful eyes, in him thy loving heart.”', 'In the noon and the afternoon of life we still throb at the recollection of\\ndays when happiness was not happy enough, but must be drugged with the relish\\nof pain and fear; for he touched the secret of the matter who said of\\nlove,—', '“All other pleasures are not worth its pains:”', 'and when the day was not long enough, but the night too must be consumed in\\nkeen recollections; when the head boiled all night on the pillow with the\\ngenerous deed it resolved on; when the moonlight was a pleasing fever and the\\nstars were letters and the flowers ciphers and the air was coined into song;\\nwhen all business seemed an impertinence, and all the men and women running to\\nand fro in the streets, mere pictures.', 'The passion rebuilds the world for the youth. It makes all things alive and\\nsignificant. Nature grows conscious. Every bird on the boughs of the tree sings\\nnow to his heart and soul. The notes are almost articulate. The clouds have\\nfaces as he looks on them. The trees of the forest, the waving grass and the\\npeeping flowers have grown intelligent; and he almost fears to trust them with\\nthe secret which they seem to invite. Yet nature soothes and sympathizes. In\\nthe green solitude he finds a dearer home than with men:—', '“Fountain-heads and pathless groves,\\nPlaces which pale passion loves,\\nMoonlight walks, when all the fowls\\nAre safely housed, save bats and owls,\\nA midnight bell, a passing groan,—\\nThese are the sounds we feed upon.”', 'Behold there in the wood the fine madman! He is a palace of sweet sounds and\\nsights; he dilates; he is twice a man; he walks with arms akimbo; he\\nsoliloquizes; he accosts the grass and the trees; he feels the blood of the\\nviolet, the clover and the lily in his veins; and he talks with the brook that\\nwets his foot.', 'The heats that have opened his perceptions of natural beauty have made him love\\nmusic and verse. It is a fact often observed, that men have written good verses\\nunder the inspiration of passion, who cannot write well under any other\\ncircumstances.', 'The like force has the passion over all his nature. It expands the sentiment;\\nit makes the clown gentle and gives the coward heart. Into the most pitiful and\\nabject it will infuse a heart and courage to defy the world, so only it have\\nthe countenance of the beloved object. In giving him to another it still more\\ngives him to himself. He is a new man, with new perceptions, new and keener\\npurposes, and a religious solemnity of character and aims. He does not longer\\nappertain to his family and society; he is somewhat; he is a\\nperson; he is a soul.', 'And here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence which is\\nthus potent over the human youth. Beauty, whose revelation to man we now\\ncelebrate, welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine, which pleases\\neverybody with it and with themselves, seems sufficient to itself. The lover\\ncannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and solitary. Like a tree in flower,\\nso much soft, budding, informing loveliness is society for itself; and she\\nteaches his eye why Beauty was pictured with Loves and Graces attending her\\nsteps. Her existence makes the world rich. Though she extrudes all other\\npersons from his attention as cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by\\ncarrying out her own being into somewhat impersonal, large, mundane, so that\\nthe maiden stands to him for a representative of all select things and virtues.\\nFor that reason the lover never sees personal resemblances in his mistress to\\nher kindred or to others. His friends find in her a likeness to her mother, or\\nher sisters, or to persons not of her blood. The lover sees no resemblance\\nexcept to summer evenings and diamond mornings, to rainbows and the song of\\nbirds.', 'The ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue. Who can analyze the\\nnameless charm which glances from one and another face and form? We are touched\\nwith emotions of tenderness and complacency, but we cannot find whereat this\\ndainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points. It is destroyed for the\\nimagination by any attempt to refer it to organization. Nor does it point to\\nany relations of friendship or love known and described in society, but, as it\\nseems to me, to a quite other and unattainable sphere, to relations of\\ntranscendent delicacy and sweetness, to what roses and violets hint and\\nforeshow. We cannot approach beauty. Its nature is like opaline\\ndoves’-neck lustres, hovering and evanescent. Herein it resembles the\\nmost excellent things, which all have this rainbow character, defying all\\nattempts at appropriation and use. What else did Jean Paul Richter signify,\\nwhen he said to music, “Away! away! thou speakest to me of things which\\nin all my endless life I have not found, and shall not find.” The same\\nfluency may be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue is then\\nbeautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing out of\\ncriticism and can no longer be defined by compass and measuring-wand, but\\ndemands an active imagination to go with it and to say what it is in the act of\\ndoing. The god or hero of the sculptor is always represented in a transition\\nfrom that which is representable to the senses, to that which is\\nnot. Then first it ceases to be a stone. The same remark holds of painting. And\\nof poetry the success is not attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it\\nastonishes and fires us with new endeavors after the unattainable. Concerning\\nit Landor inquires “whether it is not to be referred to some purer state\\nof sensation and existence.”', 'In like manner, personal beauty is then first charming and itself when it\\ndissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an end; when it\\nsuggests gleams and visions and not earthly satisfactions; when it makes the\\nbeholder feel his unworthiness; when he cannot feel his right to it, though he\\nwere Cæsar; he cannot feel more right to it than to the firmament and the\\nsplendors of a sunset.', 'Hence arose the saying, “If I love you, what is that to you?” We\\nsay so because we feel that what we love is not in your will, but above it. It\\nis not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in yourself and\\ncan never know.', 'This agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient writers\\ndelighted in; for they said that the soul of man, embodied here on earth, went\\nroaming up and down in quest of that other world of its own out of which it\\ncame into this, but was soon stupefied by the light of the natural sun, and\\nunable to see any other objects than those of this world, which are but shadows\\nof real things. Therefore the Deity sends the glory of youth before the soul,\\nthat it may avail itself of beautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the\\ncelestial good and fair; and the man beholding such a person in the female sex\\nruns to her and finds the highest joy in contemplating the form, movement, and\\nintelligence of this person, because it suggests to him the presence of that\\nwhich indeed is within the beauty, and the cause of the beauty.', 'If however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul was gross,\\nand misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped nothing but sorrow; body\\nbeing unable to fulfil the promise which beauty holds out; but if, accepting\\nthe hint of these visions and suggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the\\nsoul passes through the body and falls to admire strokes of character, and the\\nlovers contemplate one another in their discourses and their actions, then they\\npass to the true palace of beauty, more and more inflame their love of it, and\\nby this love extinguishing the base affection, as the sun puts out the fire by\\nshining on the hearth, they become pure and hallowed. By conversation with that\\nwhich is in itself excellent, magnanimous, lowly, and just, the lover comes to\\na warmer love of these nobilities, and a quicker apprehension of them. Then he\\npasses from loving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the one\\nbeautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the society of all true\\nand pure souls. In the particular society of his mate he attains a clearer\\nsight of any spot, any taint which her beauty has contracted from this world,\\nand is able to point it out, and this with mutual joy that they are now able,\\nwithout offence, to indicate blemishes and hindrances in each other, and give\\nto each all help and comfort in curing the same. And beholding in many souls\\nthe traits of the divine beauty, and separating in each soul that which is\\ndivine from the taint which it has contracted in the world, the lover ascends\\nto the highest beauty, to the love and knowledge of the Divinity, by steps on\\nthis ladder of created souls.', 'Somewhat like this have the truly wise told us of love in all ages. The\\ndoctrine is not old, nor is it new. If Plato, Plutarch and Apuleius taught it,\\nso have Petrarch, Angelo and Milton. It awaits a truer unfolding in opposition\\nand rebuke to that subterranean prudence which presides at marriages with words\\nthat take hold of the upper world, whilst one eye is prowling in the cellar; so\\nthat its gravest discourse has a savor of hams and powdering-tubs. Worst, when\\nthis sensualism intrudes into the education of young women, and withers the\\nhope and affection of human nature by teaching that marriage signifies nothing\\nbut a housewife’s thrift, and that woman’s life has no other aim.', 'But this dream of love, though beautiful, is only one scene in our play. In the\\nprocession of the soul from within outward, it enlarges its circles ever, like\\nthe pebble thrown into the pond, or the light proceeding from an orb. The rays\\nof the soul alight first on things nearest, on every utensil and toy, on nurses\\nand domestics, on the house and yard and passengers, on the circle of household\\nacquaintance, on politics and geography and history. But things are ever\\ngrouping themselves according to higher or more interior laws. Neighborhood,\\nsize, numbers, habits, persons, lose by degrees their power over us. Cause and\\neffect, real affinities, the longing for harmony between the soul and the\\ncircumstance, the progressive, idealizing instinct, predominate later, and the\\nstep backward from the higher to the lower relations is impossible. Thus even\\nlove, which is the deification of persons, must become more impersonal every\\nday. Of this at first it gives no hint. Little think the youth and maiden who\\nare glancing at each other across crowded rooms with eyes so full of mutual\\nintelligence, of the precious fruit long hereafter to proceed from this new,\\nquite external stimulus. The work of vegetation begins first in the\\nirritability of the bark and leaf-buds. From exchanging glances, they advance\\nto acts of courtesy, of gallantry, then to fiery passion, to plighting troth\\nand marriage. Passion beholds its object as a perfect unit. The soul is wholly\\nembodied, and the body is wholly ensouled:—', '“Her pure and eloquent blood\\nSpoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought,\\nThat one might almost say her body thought.”', 'Romeo, if dead, should be cut up into little stars to make the heavens fine.\\nLife, with this pair, has no other aim, asks no more, than Juliet,—than\\nRomeo. Night, day, studies, talents, kingdoms, religion, are all contained in\\nthis form full of soul, in this soul which is all form. The lovers delight in\\nendearments, in avowals of love, in comparisons of their regards. When alone,\\nthey solace themselves with the remembered image of the other. Does that other\\nsee the same star, the same melting cloud, read the same book, feel the same\\nemotion, that now delight me? They try and weigh their affection, and adding up\\ncostly advantages, friends, opportunities, properties, exult in discovering\\nthat willingly, joyfully, they would give all as a ransom for the beautiful,\\nthe beloved head, not one hair of which shall be harmed. But the lot of\\nhumanity is on these children. Danger, sorrow, and pain arrive to them, as to\\nall. Love prays. It makes covenants with Eternal Power in behalf of this dear\\nmate. The union which is thus effected and which adds a new value to every atom\\nin nature—for it transmutes every thread throughout the whole web of\\nrelation into a golden ray, and bathes the soul in a new and sweeter\\nelement—is yet a temporary state. Not always can flowers, pearls, poetry,\\nprotestations, nor even home in another heart, content the awful soul that\\ndwells in clay. It arouses itself at last from these endearments, as toys, and\\nputs on the harness and aspires to vast and universal aims. The soul which is\\nin the soul of each, craving a perfect beatitude, detects incongruities,\\ndefects and disproportion in the behavior of the other. Hence arise surprise,\\nexpostulation and pain. Yet that which drew them to each other was signs of\\nloveliness, signs of virtue; and these virtues are there, however eclipsed.\\nThey appear and reappear and continue to attract; but the regard changes, quits\\nthe sign and attaches to the substance. This repairs the wounded affection.\\nMeantime, as life wears on, it proves a game of permutation and combination of\\nall possible positions of the parties, to employ all the resources of each and\\nacquaint each with the strength and weakness of the other. For it is the nature\\nand end of this relation, that they should represent the human race to each\\nother. All that is in the world, which is or ought to be known, is cunningly\\nwrought into the texture of man, of woman:—', '“The person love does to us fit,\\nLike manna, has the taste of all in it.”', 'The world rolls; the circumstances vary every hour. The angels that inhabit\\nthis temple of the body appear at the windows, and the gnomes and vices also.\\nBy all the virtues they are united. If there be virtue, all the vices are known\\nas such; they confess and flee. Their once flaming regard is sobered by time in\\neither breast, and losing in violence what it gains in extent, it becomes a\\nthorough good understanding. They resign each other without complaint to the\\ngood offices which man and woman are severally appointed to discharge in time,\\nand exchange the passion which once could not lose sight of its object, for a\\ncheerful, disengaged furtherance, whether present or absent, of each\\nother’s designs. At last they discover that all which at first drew them\\ntogether,—those once sacred features, that magical play of\\ncharms,—was deciduous, had a prospective end, like the scaffolding by\\nwhich the house was built; and the purification of the intellect and the heart\\nfrom year to year is the real marriage, foreseen and prepared from the first,\\nand wholly above their consciousness. Looking at these aims with which two\\npersons, a man and a woman, so variously and correlatively gifted, are shut up\\nin one house to spend in the nuptial society forty or fifty years, I do not\\nwonder at the emphasis with which the heart prophesies this crisis from early\\ninfancy, at the profuse beauty with which the instincts deck the nuptial bower,\\nand nature and intellect and art emulate each other in the gifts and the melody\\nthey bring to the epithalamium.', 'Thus are we put in training for a love which knows not sex, nor person, nor\\npartiality, but which seeks virtue and wisdom everywhere, to the end of\\nincreasing virtue and wisdom. We are by nature observers, and thereby learners.\\nThat is our permanent state. But we are often made to feel that our affections\\nare but tents of a night. Though slowly and with pain, the objects of the\\naffections change, as the objects of thought do. There are moments when the\\naffections rule and absorb the man and make his happiness dependent on a person\\nor persons. But in health the mind is presently seen again,—its\\noverarching vault, bright with galaxies of immutable lights, and the warm loves\\nand fears that swept over us as clouds must lose their finite character and\\nblend with God, to attain their own perfection. But we need not fear that we\\ncan lose any thing by the progress of the soul. The soul may be trusted to the\\nend. That which is so beautiful and attractive as these relations, must be\\nsucceeded and supplanted only by what is more beautiful, and so on for ever.', 'A ruddy drop of manly blood\\nThe surging sea outweighs;\\nThe world uncertain comes and goes,\\nThe lover rooted stays.\\nI fancied he was fled,\\nAnd, after many a year,\\nGlowed unexhausted kindliness\\nLike daily sunrise there.\\nMy careful heart was free again,—\\nO friend, my bosom said,\\nThrough thee alone the sky is arched,\\nThrough thee the rose is red,\\nAll things through thee take nobler form\\nAnd look beyond the earth,\\nThe mill-round of our fate appears\\nA sun-path in thy worth.\\nMe too thy nobleness has taught\\nTo master my despair;\\nThe fountains of my hidden life\\nAre through thy friendship fair.', 'We have a great deal more kindness than is ever spoken.

See, in any house where virtue and self-respect\\nabide, the palpitation which the approach of a stranger causes. A commended\\nstranger is expected and announced, and an uneasiness betwixt pleasure and pain\\ninvades all the hearts of a household. His arrival almost brings fear to the\\ngood hearts that would welcome him. The house is dusted, all things fly into\\ntheir places, the old coat is exchanged for the new, and they must get up a\\ndinner if they can. Of a commended stranger, only the good report is told by\\nothers, only the good and new is heard by us. He stands to us for humanity. He\\nis what we wish. Having imagined and invested him, we ask how we should stand\\nrelated in conversation and action with such a man, and are uneasy with fear.\\nThe same idea exalts conversation with him. We talk better than we are wont. We\\nhave the nimblest fancy, a richer memory, and our dumb devil has taken leave\\nfor the time. For long hours we can continue a series of sincere, graceful,\\nrich communications, drawn from the oldest, secretest experience, so that they\\nwho sit by, of our own kinsfolk and acquaintance, shall feel a lively surprise\\nat our unusual powers. But as soon as the stranger begins to intrude his\\npartialities, his definitions, his defects, into the conversation, it is all\\nover. He has heard the first, the last and best he will ever hear from us. He\\nis no stranger now. Vulgarity, ignorance, misapprehension are old\\nacquaintances. Now, when he comes, he may get the order, the dress and the\\ndinner,—but the throbbing of the heart and the communications of the\\nsoul, no more.', 'What is so pleasant as these jets of affection which make a young world for me\\nagain? What so delicious as a just and firm encounter of two, in a thought, in\\na feeling? How beautiful, on their approach to this beating heart, the steps\\nand forms of the gifted and the true! The moment we indulge our affections, the\\nearth is metamorphosed; there is no winter and no night; all tragedies, all\\nennuis vanish,—all duties even; nothing fills the proceeding eternity but\\nthe forms all radiant of beloved persons. Let the soul be assured that\\nsomewhere in the universe it should rejoin its friend, and it would be content\\nand cheerful alone for a thousand years.', 'I awoke this morning with devout thanksgiving for my friends, the old and the\\nnew. Shall I not call God the Beautiful, who daily showeth himself so to me in\\nhis gifts? I chide society, I embrace solitude, and yet I am not so ungrateful\\nas not to see the wise, the lovely and the noble-minded, as from time to time\\nthey pass my gate. Who hears me, who understands me, becomes mine,—a\\npossession for all time. Nor is Nature so poor but she gives me this joy\\nseveral times, and thus we weave social threads of our own, a new web of\\nrelations; and, as many thoughts in succession substantiate themselves, we\\nshall by and by stand in a new world of our own creation, and no longer\\nstrangers and pilgrims in a traditionary globe. My friends have come to me\\nunsought. The great God gave them to me. By oldest right, by the divine\\naffinity of virtue with itself, I find them, or rather not I but the Deity in\\nme and in them derides and cancels the thick walls of individual character,\\nrelation, age, sex, circumstance, at which he usually connives, and now makes\\nmany one. High thanks I owe you, excellent lovers, who carry out the world for\\nme to new and noble depths, and enlarge the meaning of all my thoughts. These\\nare new poetry of the first Bard,—poetry without stop,—hymn, ode\\nand epic, poetry still flowing, Apollo and the Muses chanting still. Will these\\ntoo separate themselves from me again, or some of them? I know not, but I fear\\nit not; for my relation to them is so pure, that we hold by simple affinity,\\nand the Genius of my life being thus social, the same affinity will exert its\\nenergy on whomsoever is as noble as these men and women, wherever I may be.', 'I confess to an extreme tenderness of nature on this point. It is almost\\ndangerous to me to “crush the sweet poison of misused wine” of the\\naffections. A new person is to me a great event and hinders me from sleep. I\\nhave often had fine fancies about persons which have given me delicious hours;\\nbut the joy ends in the day; it yields no fruit. Thought is not born of it; my\\naction is very little modified. I must feel pride in my friend’s\\naccomplishments as if they were mine, and a property in his virtues. I feel as\\nwarmly when he is praised, as the lover when he hears applause of his engaged\\nmaiden. We over-estimate the conscience of our friend. His goodness seems\\nbetter than our goodness, his nature finer, his temptations less. Every thing\\nthat is his,—his name, his form, his dress, books and\\ninstruments,—fancy enhances. Our own thought sounds new and larger from\\nhis mouth.', 'Yet the systole and diastole of the heart are not without their analogy in the\\nebb and flow of love. Friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good\\nto be believed. The lover, beholding his maiden, half knows that she is not\\nverily that which he worships; and in the golden hour of friendship we are\\nsurprised with shades of suspicion and unbelief. We doubt that we bestow on our\\nhero the virtues in which he shines, and afterwards worship the form to which\\nwe have ascribed this divine inhabitation. In strictness, the soul does not\\nrespect men as it respects itself. In strict science all persons underlie the\\nsame condition of an infinite remoteness. Shall we fear to cool our love by\\nmining for the metaphysical foundation of this Elysian temple? Shall I not be\\nas real as the things I see? If I am, I shall not fear to know them for what\\nthey are. Their essence is not less beautiful than their appearance, though it\\nneeds finer organs for its apprehension. The root of the plant is not unsightly\\nto science, though for chaplets and festoons we cut the stem short. And I must\\nhazard the production of the bald fact amidst these pleasing reveries, though\\nit should prove an Egyptian skull at our banquet. A man who stands united with\\nhis thought conceives magnificently of himself. He is conscious of a universal\\nsuccess, even though bought by uniform particular failures. No advantages, no\\npowers, no gold or force, can be any match for him. I cannot choose but rely on\\nmy own poverty more than on your wealth. I cannot make your consciousness\\ntantamount to mine. Only the star dazzles; the planet has a faint, moon-like\\nray. I hear what you say of the admirable parts and tried temper of the party\\nyou praise, but I see well that for all his purple cloaks I shall not like him,\\nunless he is at last a poor Greek like me. I cannot deny it, O friend, that the\\nvast shadow of the Phenomenal includes thee also in its pied and painted\\nimmensity,—thee also, compared with whom all else is shadow. Thou art not\\nBeing, as Truth is, as Justice is,—thou art not my soul, but a picture\\nand effigy of that. Thou hast come to me lately, and already thou art seizing\\nthy hat and cloak. Is it not that the soul puts forth friends as the tree puts\\nforth leaves, and presently, by the germination of new buds, extrudes the old\\nleaf? The law of nature is alternation for evermore. Each electrical state\\nsuperinduces the opposite. The soul environs itself with friends that it may\\nenter into a grander self-acquaintance or solitude; and it goes alone for a\\nseason, that it may exalt its conversation or society. This method betrays\\nitself along the whole history of our personal relations. The instinct of\\naffection revives the hope of union with our mates, and the returning sense of\\ninsulation recalls us from the chase. Thus every man passes his life in the\\nsearch after friendship, and if he should record his true sentiment, he might\\nwrite a letter like this to each new candidate for his love:—', 'DEAR FRIEND,', 'If I was sure of thee, sure of thy capacity, sure to match my mood with thine,\\nI should never think again of trifles in relation to thy comings and goings. I\\nam not very wise; my moods are quite attainable, and I respect thy genius; it\\nis to me as yet unfathomed; yet dare I not presume in thee a perfect\\nintelligence of me, and so thou art to me a delicious torment. Thine ever, or\\nnever.', 'Yet these uneasy pleasures and fine pains are for curiosity and not for life.\\nThey are not to be indulged. This is to weave cobweb, and not cloth. Our\\nfriendships hurry to short and poor conclusions, because we have made them a\\ntexture of wine and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the human heart. The\\nlaws of friendship are austere and eternal, of one web with the laws of nature\\nand of morals. But we have aimed at a swift and petty benefit, to suck a sudden\\nsweetness. We snatch at the slowest fruit in the whole garden of God, which\\nmany summers and many winters must ripen. We seek our friend not sacredly, but\\nwith an adulterate passion which would appropriate him to ourselves. In vain.\\nWe are armed all over with subtle antagonisms, which, as soon as we meet, begin\\nto play, and translate all poetry into stale prose. Almost all people descend\\nto meet. All association must be a compromise, and, what is worst, the very\\nflower and aroma of the flower of each of the beautiful natures disappears as\\nthey approach each other. What a perpetual disappointment is actual society,\\neven of the virtuous and gifted! After interviews have been compassed with long\\nforesight we must be tormented presently by baffled blows, by sudden,\\nunseasonable apathies, by epilepsies of wit and of animal spirits, in the\\nheyday of friendship and thought. Our faculties do not play us true, and both\\nparties are relieved by solitude.', 'I ought to be equal to every relation. It makes no difference how many friends\\nI have and what content I can find in conversing with each, if there be one to\\nwhom I am not equal. If I have shrunk unequal from one contest, the joy I find\\nin all the rest becomes mean and cowardly. I should hate myself, if then I made\\nmy other friends my asylum:—', '“The valiant warrior famoused for fight,\\nAfter a hundred victories, once foiled,\\nIs from the book of honor razed quite,\\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled.”', 'Our impatience is thus sharply rebuked. Bashfulness and apathy are a tough husk\\nin which a delicate organization is protected from premature ripening. It would\\nbe lost if it knew itself before any of the best souls were yet ripe enough to\\nknow and own it. Respect the naturlangsamkeit which hardens the ruby in\\na million years, and works in duration in which Alps and Andes come and go as\\nrainbows. The good spirit of our life has no heaven which is the price of\\nrashness. Love, which is the essence of God, is not for levity, but for the\\ntotal worth of man. Let us not have this childish luxury in our regards, but\\nthe austerest worth; let us approach our friend with an audacious trust in the\\ntruth of his heart, in the breadth, impossible to be overturned, of his\\nfoundations.', 'The attractions of this subject are not to be resisted, and I leave, for the\\ntime, all account of subordinate social benefit, to speak of that select and\\nsacred relation which is a kind of absolute, and which even leaves the language\\nof love suspicious and common, so much is this purer, and nothing is so much\\ndivine.', 'I do not wish to treat friendships daintily, but with roughest courage. When\\nthey are real, they are not glass threads or frostwork, but the solidest thing\\nwe know. For now, after so many ages of experience, what do we know of nature\\nor of ourselves? Not one step has man taken toward the solution of the problem\\nof his destiny. In one condemnation of folly stand the whole universe of men.\\nBut the sweet sincerity of joy and peace which I draw from this alliance with\\nmy brother’s soul is the nut itself whereof all nature and all thought is\\nbut the husk and shell. Happy is the house that shelters a friend! It might\\nwell be built, like a festal bower or arch, to entertain him a single day.\\nHappier, if he know the solemnity of that relation and honor its law! He who\\noffers himself a candidate for that covenant comes up, like an Olympian, to the\\ngreat games where the first-born of the world are the competitors. He proposes\\nhimself for contests where Time, Want, Danger, are in the lists, and he alone\\nis victor who has truth enough in his constitution to preserve the delicacy of\\nhis beauty from the wear and tear of all these. The gifts of fortune may be\\npresent or absent, but all the speed in that contest depends on intrinsic\\nnobleness and the contempt of trifles. There are two elements that go to the\\ncomposition of friendship, each so sovereign that I can detect no superiority\\nin either, no reason why either should be first named. One is truth. A friend\\nis a person with whom I may be sincere. Before him I may think aloud. I am\\narrived at last in the presence of a man so real and equal that I may drop even\\nthose undermost garments of dissimulation, courtesy, and second thought, which\\nmen never put off, and may deal with him with the simplicity and wholeness with\\nwhich one chemical atom meets another. Sincerity is the luxury allowed, like\\ndiadems and authority, only to the highest rank; that being permitted to\\nspeak truth, as having none above it to court or conform unto. Every man alone\\nis sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy begins. We parry and\\nfend the approach of our fellow-man by compliments, by gossip, by amusements,\\nby affairs. We cover up our thought from him under a hundred folds. I knew a\\nman who under a certain religious frenzy cast off this drapery, and omitting\\nall compliment and commonplace, spoke to the conscience of every person he\\nencountered, and that with great insight and beauty. At first he was resisted,\\nand all men agreed he was mad. But persisting—as indeed he could not help\\ndoing—for some time in this course, he attained to the advantage of\\nbringing every man of his acquaintance into true relations with him. No man\\nwould think of speaking falsely with him, or of putting him off with any chat\\nof markets or reading-rooms. But every man was constrained by so much sincerity\\nto the like plaindealing, and what love of nature, what poetry, what symbol of\\ntruth he had, he did certainly show him. But to most of us society shows not\\nits face and eye, but its side and its back. To stand in true relations with\\nmen in a false age is worth a fit of insanity, is it not? We can seldom go\\nerect. Almost every man we meet requires some civility,—requires to be\\nhumored; he has some fame, some talent, some whim of religion or philanthropy\\nin his head that is not to be questioned, and which spoils all conversation\\nwith him. But a friend is a sane man who exercises not my ingenuity, but me. My\\nfriend gives me entertainment without requiring any stipulation on my part. A\\nfriend therefore is a sort of paradox in nature. I who alone am, I who see\\nnothing in nature whose existence I can affirm with equal evidence to my own,\\nbehold now the semblance of my being, in all its height, variety, and\\ncuriosity, reiterated in a foreign form; so that a friend may well be reckoned\\nthe masterpiece of nature.', 'The other element of friendship is tenderness. We are holden to men by every\\nsort of tie, by blood, by pride, by fear, by hope, by lucre, by lust, by hate,\\nby admiration, by every circumstance and badge and trifle,—but we can\\nscarce believe that so much character can subsist in another as to draw us by\\nlove. Can another be so blessed and we so pure that we can offer him\\ntenderness? When a man becomes dear to me I have touched the goal of fortune. I\\nfind very little written directly to the heart of this matter in books. And yet\\nI have one text which I cannot choose but remember. My author\\nsays,—“I offer myself faintly and bluntly to those whose I\\neffectually am, and tender myself least to him to whom I am the most\\ndevoted.” I wish that friendship should have feet, as well as eyes and\\neloquence. It must plant itself on the ground, before it vaults over the moon.\\nI wish it to be a little of a citizen, before it is quite a cherub. We chide\\nthe citizen because he makes love a commodity. It is an exchange of gifts, of\\nuseful loans; it is good neighborhood; it watches with the sick; it holds the\\npall at the funeral; and quite loses sight of the delicacies and nobility of\\nthe relation. But though we cannot find the god under this disguise of a\\nsutler, yet on the other hand we cannot forgive the poet if he spins his thread\\ntoo fine and does not substantiate his romance by the municipal virtues of\\njustice, punctuality, fidelity and pity. I hate the prostitution of the name of\\nfriendship to signify modish and worldly alliances. I much prefer the company\\nof ploughboys and tin-peddlers to the silken and perfumed amity which\\ncelebrates its days of encounter by a frivolous display, by rides in a curricle\\nand dinners at the best taverns. The end of friendship is a commerce the most\\nstrict and homely that can be joined; more strict than any of which we have\\nexperience. It is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of\\nlife and death. It is fit for serene days and graceful gifts and country\\nrambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty, and\\npersecution. It keeps company with the sallies of the wit and the trances of\\nreligion. We are to dignify to each other the daily needs and offices of\\nman’s life, and embellish it by courage, wisdom and unity. It should\\nnever fall into something usual and settled, but should be alert and inventive\\nand add rhyme and reason to what was drudgery.', 'Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so well\\ntempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced (for even in that\\nparticular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be altogether paired),\\nthat its satisfaction can very seldom be assured. It cannot subsist in its\\nperfection, say some of those who are learned in this warm lore of the heart,\\nbetwixt more than two. I am not quite so strict in my terms, perhaps because I\\nhave never known so high a fellowship as others. I please my imagination more\\nwith a circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other and\\nbetween whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of one to\\none peremptory for conversation, which is the practice and consummation of\\nfriendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix as ill as good and bad.\\nYou shall have very useful and cheering discourse at several times with two\\nseveral men, but let all three of you come together and you shall not have one\\nnew and hearty word. Two may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part\\nin a conversation of the most sincere and searching sort. In good company there\\nis never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes place when you\\nleave them alone. In good company the individuals merge their egotism into a\\nsocial soul exactly co-extensive with the several consciousnesses there\\npresent. No partialities of friend to friend, no fondnesses of brother to\\nsister, of wife to husband, are there pertinent, but quite otherwise. Only he\\nmay then speak who can sail on the common thought of the party, and not poorly\\nlimited to his own. Now this convention, which good sense demands, destroys the\\nhigh freedom of great conversation, which requires an absolute running of two\\nsouls into one.', 'No two men but being left alone with each other enter into simpler relations.\\nYet it is affinity that determines which two shall converse. Unrelated\\nmen give little joy to each other, will never suspect the latent powers of\\neach. We talk sometimes of a great talent for conversation, as if it were a\\npermanent property in some individuals. Conversation is an evanescent\\nrelation,—no more. A man is reputed to have thought and eloquence; he\\ncannot, for all that, say a word to his cousin or his uncle. They accuse his\\nsilence with as much reason as they would blame the insignificance of a dial in\\nthe shade. In the sun it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought\\nhe will regain his tongue.', 'Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness that piques\\neach with the presence of power and of consent in the other party. Let me be\\nalone to the end of the world, rather than that my friend should overstep, by a\\nword or a look, his real sympathy. I am equally balked by antagonism and by\\ncompliance. Let him not cease an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in\\nhis being mine, is that the not mine is mine. I hate, where I\\nlooked for a manly furtherance, or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush\\nof concession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his echo. The\\ncondition which high friendship demands is ability to do without it. That high\\noffice requires great and sublime parts. There must be very two, before there\\ncan be very one. Let it be an alliance of two large, formidable natures,\\nmutually beheld, mutually feared, before yet they recognize the deep identity\\nwhich, beneath these disparities, unites them.', 'He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure that greatness\\nand goodness are always economy; who is not swift to intermeddle with his\\nfortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this. Leave to the diamond its ages to\\ngrow, nor expect to accelerate the births of the eternal. Friendship demands a\\nreligious treatment. We talk of choosing our friends, but friends are\\nself-elected. Reverence is a great part of it. Treat your friend as a\\nspectacle. Of course he has merits that are not yours, and that you cannot\\nhonor if you must needs hold him close to your person. Stand aside; give those\\nmerits room; let them mount and expand. Are you the friend of your\\nfriend’s buttons, or of his thought? To a great heart he will still be a\\nstranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come near in the holiest\\nground. Leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as property, and to suck\\na short and all-confounding pleasure, instead of the noblest benefit.', 'Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should we\\ndesecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why insist on rash\\npersonal relations with your friend? Why go to his house, or know his mother\\nand brother and sisters? Why be visited by him at your own? Are these things\\nmaterial to our covenant? Leave this touching and clawing. Let him be to me a\\nspirit. A message, a thought, a sincerity, a glance from him, I want, but not\\nnews, nor pottage. I can get politics and chat and neighborly conveniences from\\ncheaper companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure,\\nuniversal and great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is profane\\nin comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the horizon, or that\\nclump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us not vilify, but raise it\\nto that standard. That great defying eye, that scornful beauty of his mien and\\naction, do not pique yourself on reducing, but rather fortify and enhance.\\nWorship his superiorities; wish him not less by a thought, but hoard and tell\\nthem all. Guard him as thy counterpart. Let him be to thee for ever a sort of\\nbeautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly revered, and not a trivial conveniency to\\nbe soon outgrown and cast aside. The hues of the opal, the light of the\\ndiamond, are not to be seen if the eye is too near. To my friend I write a\\nletter and from him I receive a letter. That seems to you a little. It suffices\\nme. It is a spiritual gift worthy of him to give and of me to receive. It\\nprofanes nobody. In these warm lines the heart will trust itself, as it will\\nnot to the tongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier existence than all\\nthe annals of heroism have yet made good.', 'Respect so far the holy laws of this fellowship as not to prejudice its perfect\\nflower by your impatience for its opening. We must be our own before we can be\\nanother’s. There is at least this satisfaction in crime, according to the\\nLatin proverb;—you can speak to your accomplice on even terms. Crimen\\nquos inquinat, æquat. To those whom we admire and love, at first we cannot.\\nYet the least defect of self-possession vitiates, in my judgment, the entire\\nrelation. There can never be deep peace between two spirits, never mutual\\nrespect, until in their dialogue each stands for the whole world.', 'What is so great as friendship, let us carry with what grandeur of spirit we\\ncan. Let us be silent,—so we may hear the whisper of the gods. Let us not\\ninterfere. Who set you to cast about what you should say to the select souls,\\nor how to say any thing to such? No matter how ingenious, no matter how\\ngraceful and bland. There are innumerable degrees of folly and wisdom, and for\\nyou to say aught is to be frivolous. Wait, and thy heart shall speak. Wait\\nuntil the necessary and everlasting overpowers you, until day and night avail\\nthemselves of your lips. The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to\\nhave a friend is to be one. You shall not come nearer a man by getting into his\\nhouse. If unlike, his soul only flees the faster from you, and you shall never\\ncatch a true glance of his eye. We see the noble afar off and they repel us;\\nwhy should we intrude? Late,—very late,—we perceive that no\\narrangements, no introductions, no consuetudes or habits of society would be of\\nany avail to establish us in such relations with them as we desire,—but\\nsolely the uprise of nature in us to the same degree it is in them; then shall\\nwe meet as water with water; and if we should not meet them then, we shall not\\nwant them, for we are already they. In the last analysis, love is only the\\nreflection of a man’s own worthiness from other men. Men have sometimes\\nexchanged names with their friends, as if they would signify that in their\\nfriend each loved his own soul.', 'The higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy to\\nestablish it with flesh and blood. We walk alone in the world. Friends such as\\nwe desire are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope cheers ever the faithful\\nheart, that elsewhere, in other regions of the universal power, souls are now\\nacting, enduring, and daring, which can love us and which we can love. We may\\ncongratulate ourselves that the period of nonage, of follies, of blunders and\\nof shame, is passed in solitude, and when we are finished men we shall grasp\\nheroic hands in heroic hands. Only be admonished by what you already see, not\\nto strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship can be.\\nOur impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances which no god attends.\\nBy persisting in your path, though you forfeit the little you gain the great.\\nYou demonstrate yourself, so as to put yourself out of the reach of false\\nrelations, and you draw to you the first-born of the world,—those rare\\npilgrims whereof only one or two wander in nature at once, and before whom the\\nvulgar great show as spectres and shadows merely.', 'It is foolish to be afraid of making our ties too spiritual, as if so we could\\nlose any genuine love. Whatever correction of our popular views we make from\\ninsight, nature will be sure to bear us out in, and though it seem to rob us of\\nsome joy, will repay us with a greater. Let us feel if we will the absolute\\ninsulation of man. We are sure that we have all in us. We go to Europe, or we\\npursue persons, or we read books, in the instinctive faith that these will call\\nit out and reveal us to ourselves. Beggars all. The persons are such as we; the\\nEurope, an old faded garment of dead persons; the books, their ghosts. Let us\\ndrop this idolatry. Let us give over this mendicancy. Let us even bid our\\ndearest friends farewell, and defy them, saying, ‘Who are you? Unhand me:\\nI will be dependent no more.’ Ah! seest thou not, O brother, that thus we\\npart only to meet again on a higher platform, and only be more each\\nother’s because we are more our own? A friend is Janus-faced; he looks to\\nthe past and the future. He is the child of all my foregoing hours, the prophet\\nof those to come, and the harbinger of a greater friend.', 'I do then with my friends as I do with my books. I would have them where I can\\nfind them, but I seldom use them. We must have society on our own terms, and\\nadmit or exclude it on the slightest cause. I cannot afford to speak much with\\nmy friend. If he is great he makes me so great that I cannot descend to\\nconverse. In the great days, presentiments hover before me in the firmament. I\\nought then to dedicate myself to them. I go in that I may seize them, I go out\\nthat I may seize them. I fear only that I may lose them receding into the sky\\nin which now they are only a patch of brighter light. Then, though I prize my\\nfriends, I cannot afford to talk with them and study their visions, lest I lose\\nmy own. It would indeed give me a certain household joy to quit this lofty\\nseeking, this spiritual astronomy or search of stars, and come down to warm\\nsympathies with you; but then I know well I shall mourn always the vanishing of\\nmy mighty gods. It is true, next week I shall have languid moods, when I can\\nwell afford to occupy myself with foreign objects; then I shall regret the lost\\nliterature of your mind, and wish you were by my side again. But if you come,\\nperhaps you will fill my mind only with new visions; not with yourself but with\\nyour lustres, and I shall not be able any more than now to converse with you.\\nSo I will owe to my friends this evanescent intercourse. I will receive from\\nthem not what they have but what they are. They shall give me that which\\nproperly they cannot give, but which emanates from them. But they shall not\\nhold me by any relations less subtile and pure. We will meet as though we met\\nnot, and part as though we parted not.', 'It has seemed to me lately more possible than I knew, to carry a friendship\\ngreatly, on one side, without due correspondence on the other. Why should I\\ncumber myself with regrets that the receiver is not capacious? It never\\ntroubles the sun that some of his rays fall wide and vain into ungrateful\\nspace, and only a small part on the reflecting planet. Let your greatness\\neducate the crude and cold companion. If he is unequal he will presently pass\\naway; but thou art enlarged by thy own shining, and no longer a mate for frogs\\nand worms, dost soar and burn with the gods of the empyrean. It is thought a\\ndisgrace to love unrequited. But the great will see that true love cannot be\\nunrequited. True love transcends the unworthy object and dwells and broods on\\nthe eternal, and when the poor interposed mask crumbles, it is not sad, but\\nfeels rid of so much earth and feels its independency the surer. Yet these\\nthings may hardly be said without a sort of treachery to the relation. The\\nessence of friendship is entireness, a total magnanimity and trust. It must not\\nsurmise or provide for infirmity. It treats its object as a god, that it may\\ndeify both.', 'Theme no poet gladly sung,\\nFair to old and foul to young;\\nScorn not thou the love of parts,\\nAnd the articles of arts.\\nGrandeur of the perfect sphere\\nThanks the atoms that cohere.', 'What right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have Little, and that of the\\nnegative sort? My prudence consists in avoiding and going without, not in the\\ninventing of means and methods, not in adroit steering, not in gentle\\nrepairing. I have no skill to make money spend well, no genius in my economy,\\nand whoever sees my garden discovers that I must have some other garden. Yet I\\nlove facts, and hate lubricity and people without perception. Then I have the\\nsame title to write on prudence that I have to write on poetry or holiness. We\\nwrite from aspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We paint\\nthose qualities which we do not possess. The poet admires the man of energy and\\ntactics; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the bar; and where a man\\nis not vain and egotistic you shall find what he has not by his praise.\\nMoreover it would be hardly honest in me not to balance these fine lyric words\\nof Love and Friendship with words of coarser sound, and whilst my debt to my\\nsenses is real and constant, not to own it in passing.', 'Prudence is the virtue of the senses. It is the science of appearances. It is\\nthe outmost action of the inward life. It is God taking thought for oxen. It\\nmoves matter after the laws of matter. It is content to seek health of body by\\ncomplying with physical conditions, and health of mind by the laws of the\\nintellect.', 'The world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not exist for itself, but\\nhas a symbolic character; and a true prudence or law of shows recognizes the\\nco-presence of other laws and knows that its own office is subaltern; knows\\nthat it is surface and not centre where it works. Prudence is false when\\ndetached. It is legitimate when it is the Natural History of the soul\\nincarnate, when it unfolds the beauty of laws within the narrow scope of the\\nsenses.', 'There are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world. It is\\nsufficient to our present purpose to indicate three. One class live to the\\nutility of the symbol, esteeming health and wealth a final good. Another class\\nlive above this mark to the beauty of the symbol, as the poet and artist and\\nthe naturalist and man of science. A third class live above the beauty of the\\nsymbol to the beauty of the thing signified; these are wise men. The first\\nclass have common sense; the second, taste; and the third, spiritual\\nperception. Once in a long time, a man traverses the whole scale, and sees and\\nenjoys the symbol solidly, then also has a clear eye for its beauty, and\\nlastly, whilst he pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature, does\\nnot offer to build houses and barns thereon,—reverencing the splendor of\\nthe God which he sees bursting through each chink and cranny.', 'The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of a base prudence,\\nwhich is a devotion to matter, as if we possessed no other faculties than the\\npalate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a prudence which adores the Rule\\nof Three, which never subscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends, and\\nasks but one question of any project,—Will it bake bread? This is a\\ndisease like a thickening of the skin until the vital organs are destroyed. But\\nculture, revealing the high origin of the apparent world and aiming at the\\nperfection of the man as the end, degrades every thing else, as health and\\nbodily life, into means. It sees prudence not to be a several faculty, but a\\nname for wisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants. Cultivated\\nmen always feel and speak so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of a civil\\nor social measure, great personal influence, a graceful and commanding address,\\nhad their value as proofs of the energy of the spirit. If a man lose his\\nbalance and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake, he\\nmay be a good wheel or pin, but he is not a cultivated man.', 'The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and cowards,\\nand is the subject of all comedy. It is nature’s joke, and therefore\\nliterature’s. The true prudence limits this sensualism by admitting the\\nknowledge of an internal and real world. This recognition once made, the order\\nof the world and the distribution of affairs and times, being studied with the\\nco-perception of their subordinate place, will reward any degree of attention.\\nFor our existence, thus apparently attached in nature to the sun and the\\nreturning moon and the periods which they mark,—so susceptible to climate\\nand to country, so alive to social good and evil, so fond of splendor and so\\ntender to hunger and cold and debt,—reads all its primary lessons out of\\nthese books.', 'Prudence does not go behind nature and ask whence it is. It takes the laws of\\nthe world whereby man’s being is conditioned, as they are, and keeps\\nthese laws that it may enjoy their proper good. It respects space and time,\\nclimate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth and death. There revolve, to\\ngive bound and period to his being on all sides, the sun and moon, the great\\nformalists in the sky: here lies stubborn matter, and will not swerve from its\\nchemical routine. Here is a planted globe, pierced and belted with natural laws\\nand fenced and distributed externally with civil partitions and properties\\nwhich impose new restraints on the young inhabitant.', 'We eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by the air which blows\\naround us and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too hot, too dry\\nor too wet. Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible and divine in its coming,\\nis slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A door is to be painted, a lock\\nto be repaired. I want wood or oil, or meal or salt; the house smokes, or I\\nhave a headache; then the tax, and an affair to be transacted with a man\\nwithout heart or brains, and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very\\nawkward word,—these eat up the hours. Do what we can, summer will have\\nits flies; if we walk in the woods we must feed mosquitos; if we go a-fishing\\nwe must expect a wet coat. Then climate is a great impediment to idle persons;\\nwe often resolve to give up the care of the weather, but still we regard the\\nclouds and the rain.', 'We are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and years.\\nThe hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the northern\\ntemperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of\\nthe tropics. The islander may ramble all day at will. At night he may sleep on\\na mat under the moon, and wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without\\na prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal. The northerner is perforce\\na householder. He must brew, bake, salt and preserve his food, and pile wood\\nand coal. But as it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to without some\\nnew acquaintance with nature, and as nature is inexhaustibly significant, the\\ninhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner in force.\\nSuch is the value of these matters that a man who knows other things can never\\nknow too much of these. Let him have accurate perceptions. Let him, if he have\\nhands, handle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept and hive every\\nfact of chemistry, natural history and economics; the more he has, the less is\\nhe willing to spare any one. Time is always bringing the occasions that\\ndisclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent\\naction. The domestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock and\\nthe airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces\\nwhich others never dream of. The application of means to ends insures victory\\nand the songs of victory not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of\\nparty or of war. The good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of\\nfire-wood in a shed or in the harvesting of fruits in the cellar, as in\\nPeninsular campaigns or the files of the Department of State. In the rainy day\\nhe builds a work-bench, or gets his tool-box set in the corner of the\\nbarn-chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver and chisel.\\nHerein he tastes an old joy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of\\ngarrets, presses and corn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long\\nhousekeeping. His garden or his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes.\\nOne might find argument for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine\\nelement of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man\\nkeep the law,—any law,—and his way will be strown with\\nsatisfactions. There is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in\\nthe amount.', 'On the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence. If you think the\\nsenses final, obey their law. If you believe in the soul, do not clutch at\\nsensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect. It is\\nvinegar to the eyes to deal with men of loose and imperfect perception. Dr.\\nJohnson is reported to have said,—“If the child says he looked out\\nof this window, when he looked out of that,—whip him.” Our American\\ncharacter is marked by a more than average delight in accurate perception,\\nwhich is shown by the currency of the byword, “No mistake.” But the\\ndiscomfort of unpunctuality, of confusion of thought about facts, of\\ninattention to the wants of to-morrow, is of no nation. The beautiful laws of\\ntime and space, once dislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the\\nhive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey it will yield us\\nbees. Our words and actions to be fair must be timely. A gay and pleasant sound\\nis the whetting of the scythe in the mornings of June, yet what is more\\nlonesome and sad than the sound of a whetstone or mower’s rifle when it\\nis too late in the season to make hay? Scatter-brained and\\n“afternoon” men spoil much more than their own affair in spoiling\\nthe temper of those who deal with them. I have seen a criticism on some\\npaintings, of which I am reminded when I see the shiftless and unhappy men who\\nare not true to their senses. The last Grand Duke of Weimar, a man of superior\\nunderstanding, said,—“I have sometimes remarked in the presence of\\ngreat works of art, and just now especially in Dresden, how much a certain\\nproperty contributes to the effect which gives life to the figures, and to the\\nlife an irresistible truth. This property is the hitting, in all the figures we\\ndraw, the right centre of gravity. I mean the placing the figures firm upon\\ntheir feet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on the spot where\\nthey should look. Even lifeless figures, as vessels and stools—let them\\nbe drawn ever so correctly—lose all effect so soon as they lack the\\nresting upon their centre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and\\noscillating appearance. The Raphael in the Dresden gallery (the only greatly\\naffecting picture which I have seen) is the quietest and most passionless piece\\nyou can imagine; a couple of saints who worship the Virgin and Child.\\nNevertheless, it awakens a deeper impression than the contortions of ten\\ncrucified martyrs. For beside all the resistless beauty of form, it possesses\\nin the highest degree the property of the perpendicularity of all the\\nfigures.” This perpendicularity we demand of all the figures in this\\npicture of life. Let them stand on their feet, and not float and swing. Let us\\nknow where to find them. Let them discriminate between what they remember and\\nwhat they dreamed, call a spade a spade, give us facts, and honor their own\\nsenses with trust.', 'But what man shall dare tax another with imprudence? Who is prudent? The men we\\ncall greatest are least in this kingdom. There is a certain fatal dislocation\\nin our relation to nature, distorting our modes of living and making every law\\nour enemy, which seems at last to have aroused all the wit and virtue in the\\nworld to ponder the question of Reform. We must call the highest prudence to\\ncounsel, and ask why health and beauty and genius should now be the exception\\nrather than the rule of human nature? We do not know the properties of plants\\nand animals and the laws of nature, through our sympathy with the same; but\\nthis remains the dream of poets. Poetry and prudence should be coincident.\\nPoets should be lawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should not\\nchide and insult, but should announce and lead the civil code and the\\nday’s work. But now the two things seem irreconcilably parted. We have\\nviolated law upon law until we stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a\\ncoincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are surprised. Beauty should\\nbe the dowry of every man and woman, as invariably as sensation; but it is\\nrare. Health or sound organization should be universal. Genius should be the\\nchild of genius and every child should be inspired; but now it is not to be\\npredicted of any child, and nowhere is it pure. We call partial half-lights, by\\ncourtesy, genius; talent which converts itself to money; talent which glitters\\nto-day that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow; and society is officered by\\nmen of parts, as they are properly called, and not by divine men. These\\nuse their gifts to refine luxury, not to abolish it. Genius is always ascetic,\\nand piety, and love. Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and they\\nfind beauty in rites and bounds that resist it.', 'We have found out fine names to cover our sensuality withal, but no gifts can\\nraise intemperance. The man of talent affects to call his transgressions of the\\nlaws of the senses trivial and to count them nothing considered with his\\ndevotion to his art. His art never taught him lewdness, nor the love of wine,\\nnor the wish to reap where he had not sowed. His art is less for every\\ndeduction from his holiness, and less for every defect of common sense. On him\\nwho scorned the world as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge. He that\\ndespiseth small things will perish by little and little. Goethe’s Tasso\\nis very likely to be a pretty fair historical portrait, and that is true\\ntragedy. It does not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard\\nthe Third oppresses and slays a score of innocent persons, as when Antonio and\\nTasso, both apparently right, wrong each other. One living after the maxims of\\nthis world and consistent and true to them, the other fired with all divine\\nsentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without submitting to\\ntheir law. That is a grief we all feel, a knot we cannot untie. Tasso’s\\nis no infrequent case in modern biography. A man of genius, of an ardent\\ntemperament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent, becomes presently\\nunfortunate, querulous, a “discomfortable cousin,” a thorn to\\nhimself and to others.', 'The scholar shames us by his bifold life. Whilst something higher than prudence\\nis active, he is admirable; when common sense is wanted, he is an encumbrance.\\nYesterday, Cæsar was not so great; to-day, the felon at the gallows’ foot\\nis not more miserable. Yesterday, radiant with the light of an ideal world in\\nwhich he lives, the first of men; and now oppressed by wants and by sickness,\\nfor which he must thank himself. He resembles the pitiful drivellers whom\\ntravellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of Constantinople, who skulk\\nabout all day, yellow, emaciated, ragged, sneaking; and at evening, when the\\nbazaars are open, slink to the opium-shop, swallow their morsel and become\\ntranquil and glorified seers. And who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent\\ngenius struggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last\\nsinking, chilled, exhausted and fruitless, like a giant slaughtered by pins?', 'Is it not better that a man should accept the first pains and mortifications of\\nthis sort, which nature is not slack in sending him, as hints that he must\\nexpect no other good than the just fruit of his own labor and self-denial?\\nHealth, bread, climate, social position, have their importance, and he will\\ngive them their due. Let him esteem Nature a perpetual counsellor, and her\\nperfections the exact measure of our deviations. Let him make the night night,\\nand the day day. Let him control the habit of expense. Let him see that as much\\nwisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an empire, and as much wisdom\\nmay be drawn from it. The laws of the world are written out for him on every\\npiece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will not be the better for\\nknowing, were it only the wisdom of Poor Richard, or the State-Street prudence\\nof buying by the acre to sell by the foot; or the thrift of the agriculturist,\\nto stick a tree between whiles, because it will grow whilst he sleeps; or the\\nprudence which consists in husbanding little strokes of the tool, little\\nportions of time, particles of stock and small gains. The eye of prudence may\\nnever shut. Iron, if kept at the ironmonger’s, will rust; beer, if not\\nbrewed in the right state of the atmosphere, will sour; timber of ships will\\nrot at sea, or if laid up high and dry, will strain, warp and dry-rot; money,\\nif kept by us, yields no rent and is liable to loss; if invested, is liable to\\ndepreciation of the particular kind of stock. Strike, says the smith, the iron\\nis white; keep the rake, says the haymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and\\nthe cart as nigh the rake. Our Yankee trade is reputed to be very much on the\\nextreme of this prudence. It takes bank-notes, good, bad, clean, ragged, and\\nsaves itself by the speed with which it passes them off. Iron cannot rust, nor\\nbeer sour, nor timber rot, nor calicoes go out of fashion, nor money stocks\\ndepreciate, in the few swift moments in which the Yankee suffers any one of\\nthem to remain in his possession. In skating over thin ice our safety is in our\\nspeed.', 'Let him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him learn that every thing in\\nnature, even motes and feathers, go by law and not by luck, and that what he\\nsows he reaps. By diligence and self-command let him put the bread he eats at\\nhis own disposal, that he may not stand in bitter and false relations to other\\nmen; for the best good of wealth is freedom. Let him practise the minor\\nvirtues. How much of human life is lost in waiting! let him not make his\\nfellow-creatures wait. How many words and promises are promises of\\nconversation! Let his be words of fate. When he sees a folded and sealed scrap\\nof paper float round the globe in a pine ship and come safe to the eye for\\nwhich it was written, amidst a swarming population, let him likewise feel the\\nadmonition to integrate his being across all these distracting forces, and keep\\na slender human word among the storms, distances and accidents that drive us\\nhither and thither, and, by persistency, make the paltry force of one man\\nreappear to redeem its pledge after months and years in the most distant\\nclimates.', 'We must not try to write the laws of any one virtue, looking at that only.\\nHuman nature loves no contradictions, but is symmetrical. The prudence which\\nsecures an outward well-being is not to be studied by one set of men, whilst\\nheroism and holiness are studied by another, but they are reconcilable.\\nPrudence concerns the present time, persons, property and existing forms. But\\nas every fact hath its roots in the soul, and if the soul were changed, would\\ncease to be, or would become some other thing,—the proper administration\\nof outward things will always rest on a just apprehension of their cause and\\norigin; that is, the good man will be the wise man, and the single-hearted the\\npolitic man. Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the\\nliar, but is a stab at the health of human society. On the most profitable lie\\nthe course of events presently lays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites\\nfrankness, puts the parties on a convenient footing and makes their business a\\nfriendship. Trust men and they will be true to you; treat them greatly and they\\nwill show themselves great, though they make an exception in your favor to all\\ntheir rules of trade.', 'So, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things, prudence does not consist\\nin evasion or in flight, but in courage. He who wishes to walk in the most\\npeaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself up to resolution.\\nLet him front the object of his worst apprehension, and his stoutness will\\ncommonly make his fear groundless. The Latin proverb says, “In battles\\nthe eye is first overcome.” Entire self-possession may make a battle very\\nlittle more dangerous to life than a match at foils or at football. Examples\\nare cited by soldiers of men who have seen the cannon pointed and the fire\\ngiven to it, and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball. The terrors\\nof the storm are chiefly confined to the parlor and the cabin. The drover, the\\nsailor, buffets it all day, and his health renews itself at as vigorous a pulse\\nunder the sleet as under the sun of June.', 'In the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbors, fear comes readily to\\nheart and magnifies the consequence of the other party; but it is a bad\\ncounsellor. Every man is actually weak and apparently strong. To himself he\\nseems weak; to others, formidable. You are afraid of Grim; but Grim also is\\nafraid of you. You are solicitous of the good-will of the meanest person,\\nuneasy at his ill-will. But the sturdiest offender of your peace and of the\\nneighborhood, if you rip up his claims, is as thin and timid as any, and\\nthe peace of society is often kept, because, as children say, one is afraid,\\nand the other dares not. Far off, men swell, bully and threaten; bring them\\nhand to hand, and they are a feeble folk.', 'It is a proverb that ‘courtesy costs nothing’; but calculation\\nmight come to value love for its profit. Love is fabled to be blind, but\\nkindness is necessary to perception; love is not a hood, but an eye-water. If\\nyou meet a sectary or a hostile partisan, never recognize the dividing lines,\\nbut meet on what common ground remains,—if only that the sun shines and\\nthe rain rains for both; the area will widen very fast, and ere you know it,\\nthe boundary mountains on which the eye had fastened have melted into air. If\\nthey set out to contend, Saint Paul will lie and Saint John will hate. What\\nlow, poor, paltry, hypocritical people an argument on religion will make of the\\npure and chosen souls! They will shuffle and crow, crook and hide, feign to\\nconfess here, only that they may brag and conquer there, and not a thought has\\nenriched either party, and not an emotion of bravery, modesty, or hope. So\\nneither should you put yourself in a false position with your contemporaries by\\nindulging a vein of hostility and bitterness. Though your views are in straight\\nantagonism to theirs, assume an identity of sentiment, assume that you are\\nsaying precisely that which all think, and in the flow of wit and love roll out\\nyour paradoxes in solid column, with not the infirmity of a doubt. So at least\\nshall you get an adequate deliverance. The natural motions of the soul are so\\nmuch better than the voluntary ones that you will never do yourself justice in\\ndispute. The thought is not then taken hold of by the right handle, does not\\nshow itself proportioned and in its true bearings, but bears extorted, hoarse,\\nand half witness. But assume a consent and it shall presently be granted, since\\nreally and underneath their external diversities, all men are of one heart and\\nmind.', 'Wisdom will never let us stand with any man or men on an unfriendly footing. We\\nrefuse sympathy and intimacy with people, as if we waited for some better\\nsympathy and intimacy to come. But whence and when? To-morrow will be like\\nto-day. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live. Our friends and\\nfellow-workers die off from us. Scarcely can we say we see new men, new women,\\napproaching us. We are too old to regard fashion, too old to expect patronage\\nof any greater or more powerful. Let us suck the sweetness of those affections\\nand consuetudes that grow near us. These old shoes are easy to the feet.\\nUndoubtedly we can easily pick faults in our company, can easily whisper names\\nprouder, and that tickle the fancy more.

If not the Deity but our\\nambition hews and shapes the new relations, their virtue escapes, as\\nstrawberries lose their flavor in garden-beds.', 'Thus truth, frankness, courage, love, humility and all the virtues range\\nthemselves on the side of prudence, or the art of securing a present\\nwell-being.

When any Rodrigo, Pedro or Valerio enters, though he be a stranger,\\nthe duke or governor exclaims, ‘This is a gentleman,—and proffers\\ncivilities without end; but all the rest are slag and refuse. In harmony with\\nthis delight in personal advantages there is in their plays a certain heroic\\ncast of character and dialogue,—as in Bonduca, Sophocles, the Mad Lover,\\nthe Double Marriage,—wherein the speaker is so earnest and cordial and on\\nsuch deep grounds of character, that the dialogue, on the slightest additional\\nincident in the plot, rises naturally into poetry. Among many texts take the\\nfollowing. The Roman Martius has conquered Athens,—all but the invincible\\nspirits of Sophocles, the duke of Athens, and Dorigen, his wife. The beauty of\\nthe latter inflames Martius, and he seeks to save her husband; but Sophocles\\nwill not ask his life, although assured that a word will save him, and the\\nexecution of both proceeds:—', 'Valerius. Bid thy wife farewell.\\n\\nSophocles. No, I will take no leave. My Dorigen,\\nYonder, above, ’bout Ariadne’s crown,\\nMy spirit shall hover for thee. Prithee, haste.\\n\\nDorigen. Stay, Sophocles,—with this tie up my sight;\\nLet not soft nature so transformed be,\\nAnd lose her gentler sexed humanity,\\nTo make me see my lord bleed. So, ’tis well;\\nNever one object underneath the sun\\nWill I behold before my Sophocles:\\nFarewell; now teach the Romans how to die.\\n\\nMartius. Dost know what ’t is to die?\\n\\nSophocles. Thou dost not, Martius,\\nAnd, therefore, not what ’tis to live; to die\\nIs to begin to live. It is to end\\nAn old, stale, weary work, and to commence\\nA newer and a better. ’Tis to leave\\nDeceitful knaves for the society\\nOf gods and goodness. Thou thyself must part\\nAt last from all thy garlands, pleasures, triumphs,\\nAnd prove thy fortitude what then ’t will do.\\n\\nValerius. But art not grieved nor vexed to leave thy life thus?\\n\\nSophocles. Why should I grieve or vex for being sent\\nTo them I ever loved best? Now I’ll kneel,\\nBut with my back toward thee; ’tis the last duty\\nThis trunk can do the gods.\\n\\nMartius. Strike, strike, Valerius,\\nOr Martius’ heart will leap out at his mouth.\\nThis is a man, a woman.

We have a great\\nmany flutes and flageolets, but not often the sound of any fife. Yet,\\nWordsworth’s “Laodamia,” and the ode of “Dion,”\\nand some sonnets, have a certain noble music; and Scott will sometimes draw a\\nstroke like the portrait of Lord Evandale given by Balfour of Burley. Thomas\\nCarlyle, with his natural taste for what is manly and daring in character, has\\nsuffered no heroic trait in his favorites to drop from his biographical and\\nhistorical pictures. Earlier, Robert Burns has given us a song or two. In the\\nHarleian Miscellanies there is an account of the battle of Lutzen which\\ndeserves to be read. And Simon Ockley’s History of the Saracens recounts\\nthe prodigies of individual valor, with admiration all the more evident on the\\npart of the narrator that he seems to think that his place in Christian Oxford\\nrequires of him some proper protestations of abhorrence. But if we explore the\\nliterature of Heroism we shall quickly come to Plutarch, who is its Doctor and\\nhistorian. To him we owe the Brasidas, the Dion, the Epaminondas, the Scipio of\\nold, and I must think we are more deeply indebted to him than to all the\\nancient writers. Each of his “Lives” is a refutation to the\\ndespondency and cowardice of our religious and political theorists. A wild\\ncourage, a Stoicism not of the schools but of the blood, shines in every\\nanecdote, and has given that book its immense fame.', 'We need books of this tart cathartic virtue more than books of political\\nscience or of private economy. Life is a festival only to the wise. Seen from\\nthe nook and chimney-side of prudence, it wears a ragged and dangerous front.\\nThe violations of the laws of nature by our predecessors and our contemporaries\\nare punished in us also. The disease and deformity around us certify the\\ninfraction of natural, intellectual, and moral laws, and often violation on\\nviolation to breed such compound misery. A lock-jaw that bends a man’s\\nhead back to his heels; hydrophobia that makes him bark at his wife and babes;\\ninsanity that makes him eat grass; war, plague, cholera, famine, indicate a\\ncertain ferocity in nature, which, as it had its inlet by human crime, must\\nhave its outlet by human suffering. Unhappily no man exists who has not in his\\nown person become to some amount a stockholder in the sin, and so made himself\\nliable to a share in the expiation.', 'Our culture therefore must not omit the arming of the man. Let him hear in\\nseason that he is born into the state of war, and that the commonwealth and his\\nown well-being require that he should not go dancing in the weeds of peace, but\\nwarned, self-collected and neither defying nor dreading the thunder, let him\\ntake both reputation and life in his hand, and, with perfect urbanity dare the\\ngibbet and the mob by the absolute truth of his speech and the rectitude of his\\nbehavior.', 'Towards all this external evil the man within the breast assumes a warlike\\nattitude, and affirms his ability to cope single-handed with the infinite army\\nof enemies. To this military attitude of the soul we give the name of Heroism.\\nIts rudest form is the contempt for safety and ease, which makes the\\nattractiveness of war. It is a self-trust which slights the restraints of\\nprudence, in the plenitude of its energy and power to repair the harms it may\\nsuffer. The hero is a mind of such balance that no disturbances can shake his\\nwill, but pleasantly and as it were merrily he advances to his own music, alike\\nin frightful alarms and in the tipsy mirth of universal dissoluteness. There is\\nsomewhat not philosophical in heroism; there is somewhat not holy in it; it\\nseems not to know that other souls are of one texture with it; it has pride; it\\nis the extreme of individual nature. Nevertheless we must profoundly revere it.\\nThere is somewhat in great actions which does not allow us to go behind them.\\nHeroism feels and never reasons, and therefore is always right; and although a\\ndifferent breeding, different religion and greater intellectual activity would\\nhave modified or even reversed the particular action, yet for the hero that\\nthing he does is the highest deed, and is not open to the censure of\\nphilosophers or divines. It is the avowal of the unschooled man that he finds a\\nquality in him that is negligent of expense, of health, of life, of danger, of\\nhatred, of reproach, and knows that his will is higher and more excellent than\\nall actual and all possible antagonists.', 'Heroism works in contradiction to the voice of mankind and in contradiction,\\nfor a time, to the voice of the great and good. Heroism is an obedience to a\\nsecret impulse of an individual’s character. Now to no other man can its\\nwisdom appear as it does to him, for every man must be supposed to see a little\\nfarther on his own proper path than any one else. Therefore just and wise men\\ntake umbrage at his act, until after some little time be past: then they see it\\nto be in unison with their acts. All prudent men see that the action is clean\\ncontrary to a sensual prosperity; for every heroic act measures itself by its\\ncontempt of some external good. But it finds its own success at last, and then\\nthe prudent also extol.', 'Self-trust is the essence of heroism. It is the state of the soul at war, and\\nits ultimate objects are the last defiance of falsehood and wrong, and the\\npower to bear all that can be inflicted by evil agents. It speaks the truth and\\nit is just, generous, hospitable, temperate, scornful of petty calculations and\\nscornful of being scorned. It persists; it is of an undaunted boldness and of a\\nfortitude not to be wearied out. Its jest is the littleness of common life.\\nThat false prudence which dotes on health and wealth is the butt and merriment\\nof heroism. Heroism, like Plotinus, is almost ashamed of its body. What shall\\nit say then to the sugar-plums and cats’-cradles, to the toilet,\\ncompliments, quarrels, cards and custard, which rack the wit of all society?\\nWhat joys has kind nature provided for us dear creatures! There seems to be no\\ninterval between greatness and meanness. When the spirit is not master of the\\nworld, then it is its dupe. Yet the little man takes the great hoax so\\ninnocently, works in it so headlong and believing, is born red, and dies gray,\\narranging his toilet, attending on his own health, laying traps for sweet food\\nand strong wine, setting his heart on a horse or a rifle, made happy with a\\nlittle gossip or a little praise, that the great soul cannot choose but laugh\\nat such earnest nonsense. “Indeed, these humble considerations make me\\nout of love with greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to take note how many\\npairs of silk stockings thou hast, namely, these and those that were the\\npeach-colored ones; or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for\\nsuperfluity, and one other for use!”', 'Citizens, thinking after the laws of arithmetic, consider the inconvenience of\\nreceiving strangers at their fireside, reckon narrowly the loss of time and the\\nunusual display; the soul of a better quality thrusts back the unseasonable\\neconomy into the vaults of life, and says, I will obey the God, and the\\nsacrifice and the fire he will provide. Ibn Hankal, the Arabian geographer,\\ndescribes a heroic extreme in the hospitality of Sogd, in Bukharia. “When\\nI was in Sogd I saw a great building, like a palace, the gates of which were\\nopen and fixed back to the wall with large nails. I asked the reason, and was\\ntold that the house had not been shut, night or day, for a hundred years.\\nStrangers may present themselves at any hour and in whatever number; the master\\nhas amply provided for the reception of the men and their animals, and is never\\nhappier than when they tarry for some time. Nothing of the kind have I seen in\\nany other country.” The magnanimous know very well that they who give\\ntime, or money, or shelter, to the stranger,—so it be done for love and\\nnot for ostentation,—do, as it were, put God under obligation to them, so\\nperfect are the compensations of the universe. In some way the time they seem\\nto lose is redeemed and the pains they seem to take remunerate themselves.\\nThese men fan the flame of human love and raise the standard of civil virtue\\namong mankind. But hospitality must be for service and not for show, or it\\npulls down the host. The brave soul rates itself too high to value itself by\\nthe splendor of its table and draperies. It gives what it hath, and all it\\nhath, but its own majesty can lend a better grace to bannocks and fair water\\nthan belong to city feasts.', 'The temperance of the hero proceeds from the same wish to do no dishonor to the\\nworthiness he has. But he loves it for its elegancy, not for its austerity. It\\nseems not worth his while to be solemn and denounce with bitterness\\nflesh-eating or wine-drinking, the use of tobacco, or opium, or tea, or silk,\\nor gold. A great man scarcely knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without\\nrailing or precision his living is natural and poetic. John Eliot, the Indian\\nApostle, drank water, and said of wine,—“It is a noble, generous\\nliquor and we should be humbly thankful for it, but, as I remember, water was\\nmade before it.” Better still is the temperance of King David, who poured\\nout on the ground unto the Lord the water which three of his warriors had\\nbrought him to drink, at the peril of their lives.', 'It is told of Brutus, that when he fell on his sword after the battle of\\nPhilippi, he quoted a line of Euripides,—“O Virtue! I have followed\\nthee through life, and I find thee at last but a shade.” I doubt not the\\nhero is slandered by this report. The heroic soul does not sell its justice and\\nits nobleness. It does not ask to dine nicely and to sleep warm. The essence of\\ngreatness is the perception that virtue is enough. Poverty is its ornament. It\\ndoes not need plenty, and can very well abide its loss.', 'But that which takes my fancy most in the heroic class, is the good-humor and\\nhilarity they exhibit. It is a height to which common duty can very well\\nattain, to suffer and to dare with solemnity. But these rare souls set opinion,\\nsuccess, and life at so cheap a rate that they will not soothe their enemies by\\npetitions, or the show of sorrow, but wear their own habitual greatness.\\nScipio, charged with peculation, refuses to do himself so great a disgrace as\\nto wait for justification, though he had the scroll of his accounts in his\\nhands, but tears it to pieces before the tribunes. Socrates’s\\ncondemnation of himself to be maintained in all honor in the Prytaneum, during\\nhis life, and Sir Thomas More’s playfulness at the scaffold, are of the\\nsame strain. In Beaumont and Fletcher’s “Sea Voyage,” Juletta\\ntells the stout captain and his company,—', 'Juletta. Why, slaves, ’tis in our power to hang ye.\\nMaster. Very likely,\\n’Tis in our powers, then, to be hanged, and scorn ye.', 'These replies are sound and whole. Sport is the bloom and glow of a perfect\\nhealth. The great will not condescend to take any thing seriously; all must be\\nas gay as the song of a canary, though it were the building of cities or the\\neradication of old and foolish churches and nations which have cumbered the\\nearth long thousands of years. Simple hearts put all the history and customs of\\nthis world behind them, and play their own game in innocent defiance of the\\nBlue-Laws of the world; and such would appear, could we see the human race\\nassembled in vision, like little children frolicking together, though to the\\neyes of mankind at large they wear a stately and solemn garb of works and\\ninfluences.', 'The interest these fine stories have for us, the power of a romance over the\\nboy who grasps the forbidden book under his bench at school, our delight in the\\nhero, is the main fact to our purpose. All these great and transcendent\\nproperties are ours. If we dilate in beholding the Greek energy, the Roman\\npride, it is that we are already domesticating the same sentiment. Let us find\\nroom for this great guest in our small houses. The first step of worthiness\\nwill be to disabuse us of our superstitious associations with places and times,\\nwith number and size. Why should these words, Athenian, Roman, Asia and\\nEngland, so tingle in the ear? Where the heart is, there the muses, there the\\ngods sojourn, and not in any geography of fame. Massachusetts, Connecticut\\nRiver and Boston Bay you think paltry places, and the ear loves names of\\nforeign and classic topography. But here we are; and, if we will tarry a\\nlittle, we may come to learn that here is best. See to it only that thyself is\\nhere, and art and nature, hope and fate, friends, angels and the Supreme Being\\nshall not be absent from the chamber where thou sittest. Epaminondas, brave and\\naffectionate, does not seem to us to need Olympus to die upon, nor the Syrian\\nsunshine. He lies very well where he is. The Jerseys were handsome ground\\nenough for Washington to tread, and London streets for the feet of Milton. A\\ngreat man makes his climate genial in the imagination of men, and its air the\\nbeloved element of all delicate spirits. That country is the fairest which is\\ninhabited by the noblest minds. The pictures which fill the imagination in\\nreading the actions of Pericles, Xenophon, Columbus, Bayard, Sidney, Hampden,\\nteach us how needlessly mean our life is; that we, by the depth of our living,\\nshould deck it with more than regal or national splendor, and act on principles\\nthat should interest man and nature in the length of our days.', 'We have seen or heard of many extraordinary young men who never ripened, or\\nwhose performance in actual life was not extraordinary. When we see their air\\nand mien, when we hear them speak of society, of books, of religion, we admire\\ntheir superiority; they seem to throw contempt on our entire polity and social\\nstate; theirs is the tone of a youthful giant who is sent to work revolutions.\\nBut they enter an active profession and the forming Colossus shrinks to the\\ncommon size of man. The magic they used was the ideal tendencies, which always\\nmake the Actual ridiculous; but the tough world had its revenge the moment they\\nput their horses of the sun to plough in its furrow. They found no example and\\nno companion, and their heart fainted. What then? The lesson they gave in their\\nfirst aspirations is yet true; and a better valor and a purer truth shall one\\nday organize their belief. Or why should a woman liken herself to any\\nhistorical woman, and think, because Sappho, or Sévigné, or De Staël, or the\\ncloistered souls who have had genius and cultivation do not satisfy the\\nimagination and the serene Themis, none can,—certainly not she? Why not?\\nShe has a new and unattempted problem to solve, perchance that of the happiest\\nnature that ever bloomed. Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her\\nway, accept the hint of each new experience, search in turn all the objects\\nthat solicit her eye, that she may learn the power and the charm of her\\nnew-born being, which is the kindling of a new dawn in the recesses of space.\\nThe fair girl who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of\\ninfluences, so careless of pleasing, so wilful and lofty, inspires every\\nbeholder with somewhat of her own nobleness. The silent heart encourages her; O\\nfriend, never strike sail to a fear! Come into port greatly, or sail with God\\nthe seas. Not in vain you live, for every passing eye is cheered and refined by\\nthe vision.', 'The characteristic of heroism is its persistency. All men have wandering\\nimpulses, fits and starts of generosity. But when you have chosen your part,\\nabide by it, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world. The\\nheroic cannot be the common, nor the common the heroic. Yet we have the\\nweakness to expect the sympathy of people in those actions whose excellence is\\nthat they outrun sympathy and appeal to a tardy justice. If you would serve\\nyour brother, because it is fit for you to serve him, do not take back your\\nwords when you find that prudent people do not commend you. Adhere to your own\\nact, and congratulate yourself if you have done something strange and\\nextravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous age. It was a high counsel\\nthat I once heard given to a young person,—“Always do what you are\\nafraid to do.” A simple manly character need never make an apology, but\\nshould regard its past action with the calmness of Phocion, when he admitted\\nthat the event of the battle was happy, yet did not regret his dissuasion from\\nthe battle.', 'There is no weakness or exposure for which we cannot find consolation in the\\nthought—this is a part of my constitution, part of my relation and office\\nto my fellow-creature. Has nature covenanted with me that I should never appear\\nto disadvantage, never make a ridiculous figure? Let us be generous of our\\ndignity as well as of our money. Greatness once and for ever has done with\\nopinion. We tell our charities, not because we wish to be praised for them, not\\nbecause we think they have great merit, but for our justification. It is a\\ncapital blunder; as you discover when another man recites his charities.', 'To speak the truth, even with some austerity, to live with some rigor of\\ntemperance, or some extremes of generosity, seems to be an asceticism which\\ncommon good-nature would appoint to those who are at ease and in plenty, in\\nsign that they feel a brotherhood with the great multitude of suffering men.\\nAnd not only need we breathe and exercise the soul by assuming the penalties of\\nabstinence, of debt, of solitude, of unpopularity,—but it behooves the\\nwise man to look with a bold eye into those rarer dangers which sometimes\\ninvade men, and to familiarize himself with disgusting forms of disease, with\\nsounds of execration, and the vision of violent death.', 'Times of heroism are generally times of terror, but the day never shines in\\nwhich this element may not work. The circumstances of man, we say, are\\nhistorically somewhat better in this country and at this hour than perhaps ever\\nbefore. More freedom exists for culture. It will not now run against an axe at\\nthe first step out of the beaten track of opinion. But whoso is heroic will\\nalways find crises to try his edge. Human virtue demands her champions and\\nmartyrs, and the trial of persecution always proceeds. It is but the other day\\nthat the brave Lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights\\nof free speech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live.', 'I see not any road of perfect peace which a man can walk, but after the counsel\\nof his own bosom. Let him quit too much association, let him go home much, and\\nstablish himself in those courses he approves. The unremitting retention of\\nsimple and high sentiments in obscure duties is hardening the character to that\\ntemper which will work with honor, if need be in the tumult, or on the\\nscaffold. Whatever outrages have happened to men may befall a man again; and\\nvery easily in a republic, if there appear any signs of a decay of religion.\\nCoarse slander, fire, tar and feathers and the gibbet, the youth may freely\\nbring home to his mind and with what sweetness of temper he can, and inquire\\nhow fast he can fix his sense of duty, braving such penalties, whenever it may\\nplease the next newspaper and a sufficient number of his neighbors to pronounce\\nhis opinions incendiary.', 'It may calm the apprehension of calamity in the most susceptible heart to see\\nhow quick a bound Nature has set to the utmost infliction of malice.

For this reason the argument\\nwhich is always forthcoming to silence those who conceive extraordinary hopes\\nof man, namely the appeal to experience, is for ever invalid and vain. We give\\nup the past to the objector, and yet we hope. He must explain this hope. We\\ngrant that human life is mean, but how did we find out that it was mean? What\\nis the ground of this uneasiness of ours; of this old discontent? What is the\\nuniversal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by which the soul\\nmakes its enormous claim? Why do men feel that the natural history of man has\\nnever been written, but he is always leaving behind what you have said of him,\\nand it becomes old, and books of metaphysics worthless? The philosophy of six\\nthousand years has not searched the chambers and magazines of the soul. In its\\nexperiments there has always remained, in the last analysis, a residuum it\\ncould not resolve. Man is a stream whose source is hidden. Our being is\\ndescending into us from we know not whence. The most exact calculator has no\\nprescience that somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next moment. I am\\nconstrained every moment to acknowledge a higher origin for events than the\\nwill I call mine.', 'As with events, so is it with thoughts. When I watch that flowing river, which,\\nout of regions I see not, pours for a season its streams into me, I see that I\\nam a pensioner; not a cause, but a surprised spectator of this ethereal water;\\nthat I desire and look up and put myself in the attitude of reception, but from\\nsome alien energy the visions come.', 'The Supreme Critic on the errors of the past and the present, and the only\\nprophet of that which must be, is that great nature in which we rest as the\\nearth lies in the soft arms of the atmosphere; that Unity, that Over-soul,\\nwithin which every man’s particular being is contained and made one with\\nall other; that common heart of which all sincere conversation is the worship,\\nto which all right action is submission; that overpowering reality which\\nconfutes our tricks and talents, and constrains every one to pass for what he\\nis, and to speak from his character and not from his tongue, and which evermore\\ntends to pass into our thought and hand and become wisdom and virtue and power\\nand beauty. We live in succession, in division, in parts, in particles.\\nMeantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal\\nbeauty, to which every part and particle is equally related; the eternal ONE.\\nAnd this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to\\nus, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of seeing\\nand the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are\\none. We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the\\ntree; but the whole, of which these are the shining parts, is the soul. Only by\\nthe vision of that Wisdom can the horoscope of the ages be read, and by falling\\nback on our better thoughts, by yielding to the spirit of prophecy which is\\ninnate in every man, we can know what it saith. Every man’s words who\\nspeaks from that life must sound vain to those who do not dwell in the same\\nthought on their own part. I dare not speak for it. My words do not carry its\\naugust sense; they fall short and cold. Only itself can inspire whom it will,\\nand behold! their speech shall be lyrical, and sweet, and universal as the\\nrising of the wind.

All goes to show that the soul in man is not an organ, but animates and\\nexercises all the organs; is not a function, like the power of memory, of\\ncalculation, of comparison, but uses these as hands and feet; is not a faculty,\\nbut a light; is not the intellect or the will, but the master of the intellect\\nand the will; is the background of our being, in which they lie,—an\\nimmensity not possessed and that cannot be possessed. From within or from\\nbehind, a light shines through us upon things and makes us aware that we are\\nnothing, but the light is all. A man is the facade of a temple wherein all\\nwisdom and all good abide. What we commonly call man, the eating, drinking,\\nplanting, counting man, does not, as we know him, represent himself, but\\nmisrepresents himself. Him we do not respect, but the soul, whose organ he is,\\nwould he let it appear through his action, would make our knees bend. When it\\nbreathes through his intellect, it is genius; when it breathes through his\\nwill, it is virtue; when it flows through his affection, it is love. And the\\nblindness of the intellect begins when it would be something of itself. The\\nweakness of the will begins when the individual would be something of himself.\\nAll reform aims in some one particular to let the soul have its way through us;\\nin other words, to engage us to obey.', 'Of this pure nature every man is at some time sensible. Language cannot paint\\nit with his colors. It is too subtile. It is undefinable, unmeasurable; but we\\nknow that it pervades and contains us. We know that all spiritual being is in\\nman. A wise old proverb says, “God comes to see us without bell;”\\nthat is, as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite\\nheavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases,\\nand God, the cause, begins. The walls are taken away. We lie open on one side\\nto the deeps of spiritual nature, to the attributes of God. Justice we see and\\nknow, Love, Freedom, Power. These natures no man ever got above, but they tower\\nover us, and most in the moment when our interests tempt us to wound them.', 'The sovereignty of this nature whereof we speak is made known by its\\nindependency of those limitations which circumscribe us on every hand. The soul\\ncircumscribes all things. As I have said, it contradicts all experience. In\\nlike manner it abolishes time and space. The influence of the senses has in\\nmost men overpowered the mind to that degree that the walls of time and space\\nhave come to look real and insurmountable; and to speak with levity of these\\nlimits is, in the world, the sign of insanity. Yet time and space are but\\ninverse measures of the force of the soul. The spirit sports with time,—', '“Can crowd eternity into an hour,\\nOr stretch an hour to eternity.”', 'We are often made to feel that there is another youth and age than that which\\nis measured from the year of our natural birth. Some thoughts always find us\\nyoung, and keep us so. Such a thought is the love of the universal and eternal\\nbeauty. Every man parts from that contemplation with the feeling that it rather\\nbelongs to ages than to mortal life. The least activity of the intellectual\\npowers redeems us in a degree from the conditions of time. In sickness, in\\nlanguor, give us a strain of poetry or a profound sentence, and we are\\nrefreshed; or produce a volume of Plato or Shakspeare, or remind us of their\\nnames, and instantly we come into a feeling of longevity. See how the deep\\ndivine thought reduces centuries and millenniums and makes itself present\\nthrough all ages. Is the teaching of Christ less effective now than it was when\\nfirst his mouth was opened? The emphasis of facts and persons in my thought has\\nnothing to do with time. And so always the soul’s scale is one, the scale\\nof the senses and the understanding is another. Before the revelations of the\\nsoul, Time, Space and Nature shrink away. In common speech we refer all things\\nto time, as we habitually refer the immensely sundered stars to one concave\\nsphere. And so we say that the Judgment is distant or near, that the Millennium\\napproaches, that a day of certain political, moral, social reforms is at hand,\\nand the like, when we mean that in the nature of things one of the facts we\\ncontemplate is external and fugitive, and the other is permanent and connate\\nwith the soul. The things we now esteem fixed shall, one by one, detach\\nthemselves like ripe fruit from our experience, and fall. The wind shall blow\\nthem none knows whither. The landscape, the figures, Boston, London, are facts\\nas fugitive as any institution past, or any whiff of mist or smoke, and so is\\nsociety, and so is the world. The soul looketh steadily forwards, creating a\\nworld before her, leaving worlds behind her. She has no dates, nor rites, nor\\npersons, nor specialties nor men. The soul knows only the soul; the web of\\nevents is the flowing robe in which she is clothed.', 'After its own law and not by arithmetic is the rate of its progress to be\\ncomputed. The soul’s advances are not made by gradation, such as can be\\nrepresented by motion in a straight line, but rather by ascension of state,\\nsuch as can be represented by metamorphosis,—from the egg to the worm,\\nfrom the worm to the fly. The growths of genius are of a certain total\\ncharacter, that does not advance the elect individual first over John, then\\nAdam, then Richard, and give to each the pain of discovered\\ninferiority,—but by every throe of growth the man expands there where he\\nworks, passing, at each pulsation, classes, populations, of men. With each\\ndivine impulse the mind rends the thin rinds of the visible and finite, and\\ncomes out into eternity, and inspires and expires its air. It converses with\\ntruths that have always been spoken in the world, and becomes conscious of a\\ncloser sympathy with Zeno and Arrian than with persons in the house.', 'This is the law of moral and of mental gain. The simple rise as by specific\\nlevity not into a particular virtue, but into the region of all the virtues.\\nThey are in the spirit which contains them all. The soul requires purity, but\\npurity is not it; requires justice, but justice is not that; requires\\nbeneficence, but is somewhat better; so that there is a kind of descent and\\naccommodation felt when we leave speaking of moral nature to urge a virtue\\nwhich it enjoins. To the well-born child all the virtues are natural, and not\\npainfully acquired. Speak to his heart, and the man becomes suddenly virtuous.', 'Within the same sentiment is the germ of intellectual growth, which obeys the\\nsame law. Those who are capable of humility, of justice, of love, of\\naspiration, stand already on a platform that commands the sciences and arts,\\nspeech and poetry, action and grace. For whoso dwells in this moral beatitude\\nalready anticipates those special powers which men prize so highly. The lover\\nhas no talent, no skill, which passes for quite nothing with his enamoured\\nmaiden, however little she may possess of related faculty; and the heart which\\nabandons itself to the Supreme Mind finds itself related to all its works, and\\nwill travel a royal road to particular knowledges and powers. In ascending to\\nthis primary and aboriginal sentiment we have come from our remote station on\\nthe circumference instantaneously to the centre of the world, where, as in the\\ncloset of God, we see causes, and anticipate the universe, which is but a slow\\neffect.', 'One mode of the divine teaching is the incarnation of the spirit in a\\nform,—in forms, like my own. I live in society, with persons who answer\\nto thoughts in my own mind, or express a certain obedience to the great\\ninstincts to which I live. I see its presence to them. I am certified of a\\ncommon nature; and these other souls, these separated selves, draw me as\\nnothing else can. They stir in me the new emotions we call passion; of love,\\nhatred, fear, admiration, pity; thence come conversation, competition,\\npersuasion, cities and war. Persons are supplementary to the primary teaching\\nof the soul. In youth we are mad for persons. Childhood and youth see all the\\nworld in them. But the larger experience of man discovers the identical nature\\nappearing through them all. Persons themselves acquaint us with the impersonal.\\nIn all conversation between two persons tacit reference is made, as to a third\\nparty, to a common nature. That third party or common nature is not social; it\\nis impersonal; is God. And so in groups where debate is earnest, and especially\\non high questions, the company become aware that the thought rises to an equal\\nlevel in all bosoms, that all have a spiritual property in what was said, as\\nwell as the sayer. They all become wiser than they were. It arches over them\\nlike a temple, this unity of thought in which every heart beats with nobler\\nsense of power and duty, and thinks and acts with unusual solemnity. All are\\nconscious of attaining to a higher self-possession. It shines for all. There is\\na certain wisdom of humanity which is common to the greatest men with the\\nlowest, and which our ordinary education often labors to silence and obstruct.\\nThe mind is one, and the best minds, who love truth for its own sake, think\\nmuch less of property in truth. They accept it thankfully everywhere, and do\\nnot label or stamp it with any man’s name, for it is theirs long\\nbeforehand, and from eternity. The learned and the studious of thought have no\\nmonopoly of wisdom. Their violence of direction in some degree disqualifies\\nthem to think truly. We owe many valuable observations to people who are not\\nvery acute or profound, and who say the thing without effort which we want and\\nhave long been hunting in vain. The action of the soul is oftener in that which\\nis felt and left unsaid than in that which is said in any conversation. It\\nbroods over every society, and they unconsciously seek for it in each other. We\\nknow better than we do. We do not yet possess ourselves, and we know at the\\nsame time that we are much more. I feel the same truth how often in my trivial\\nconversation with my neighbors, that somewhat higher in each of us overlooks\\nthis by-play, and Jove nods to Jove from behind each of us.', 'Men descend to meet. In their habitual and mean service to the world, for which\\nthey forsake their native nobleness, they resemble those Arabian sheiks who\\ndwell in mean houses and affect an external poverty, to escape the rapacity of\\nthe Pacha, and reserve all their display of wealth for their interior and\\nguarded retirements.', 'As it is present in all persons, so it is in every period of life. It is adult\\nalready in the infant man. In my dealing with my child, my Latin and Greek, my\\naccomplishments and my money stead me nothing; but as much soul as I have\\navails. If I am wilful, he sets his will against mine, one for one, and leaves\\nme, if I please, the degradation of beating him by my superiority of strength.\\nBut if I renounce my will and act for the soul, setting that up as umpire\\nbetween us two, out of his young eyes looks the same soul; he reveres and loves\\nwith me.', 'The soul is the perceiver and revealer of truth. We know truth when we see it,\\nlet skeptic and scoffer say what they choose. Foolish people ask you, when you\\nhave spoken what they do not wish to hear, ‘How do you know it is truth,\\nand not an error of your own?’ We know truth when we see it, from\\nopinion, as we know when we are awake that we are awake. It was a grand\\nsentence of Emanuel Swedenborg, which would alone indicate the greatness of\\nthat man’s perception,—“It is no proof of a man’s\\nunderstanding to be able to confirm whatever he pleases; but to be able to\\ndiscern that what is true is true, and that what is false is false,—this\\nis the mark and character of intelligence.” In the book I read, the good\\nthought returns to me, as every truth will, the image of the whole soul. To the\\nbad thought which I find in it, the same soul becomes a discerning, separating\\nsword, and lops it away. We are wiser than we know. If we will not interfere\\nwith our thought, but will act entirely, or see how the thing stands in God, we\\nknow the particular thing, and every thing, and every man. For the Maker of all\\nthings and all persons stands behind us and casts his dread omniscience through\\nus over things.', 'But beyond this recognition of its own in particular passages of the\\nindividual’s experience, it also reveals truth. And here we should seek\\nto reinforce ourselves by its very presence, and to speak with a worthier,\\nloftier strain of that advent. For the soul’s communication of truth is\\nthe highest event in nature, since it then does not give somewhat from itself,\\nbut it gives itself, or passes into and becomes that man whom it enlightens;\\nor, in proportion to that truth he receives, it takes him to itself.', 'We distinguish the announcements of the soul, its manifestations of its own\\nnature, by the term Revelation. These are always attended by the emotion\\nof the sublime. For this communication is an influx of the Divine mind into our\\nmind. It is an ebb of the individual rivulet before the flowing surges of the\\nsea of life. Every distinct apprehension of this central commandment agitates\\nmen with awe and delight. A thrill passes through all men at the reception of\\nnew truth, or at the performance of a great action, which comes out of the\\nheart of nature. In these communications the power to see is not separated from\\nthe will to do, but the insight proceeds from obedience, and the obedience\\nproceeds from a joyful perception. Every moment when the individual feels\\nhimself invaded by it is memorable. By the necessity of our constitution a\\ncertain enthusiasm attends the individual’s consciousness of that divine\\npresence. The character and duration of this enthusiasm varies with the state\\nof the individual, from an ecstasy and trance and prophetic\\ninspiration,—which is its rarer appearance,—to the faintest glow of\\nvirtuous emotion, in which form it warms, like our household fires, all the\\nfamilies and associations of men, and makes society possible. A certain\\ntendency to insanity has always attended the opening of the religious sense in\\nmen, as if they had been “blasted with excess of light.” The\\ntrances of Socrates, the “union” of Plotinus, the vision of\\nPorphyry, the conversion of Paul, the aurora of Behmen, the convulsions of\\nGeorge Fox and his Quakers, the illumination of Swedenborg, are of this kind.\\nWhat was in the case of these remarkable persons a ravishment, has, in\\ninnumerable instances in common life, been exhibited in less striking manner.\\nEverywhere the history of religion betrays a tendency to enthusiasm. The\\nrapture of the Moravian and Quietist; the opening of the internal sense of the\\nWord, in the language of the New Jerusalem Church; the revival of the\\nCalvinistic churches; the experiences of the Methodists, are varying\\nforms of that shudder of awe and delight with which the individual soul always\\nmingles with the universal soul.', 'The nature of these revelations is the same; they are perceptions of the\\nabsolute law. They are solutions of the soul’s own questions. They do not\\nanswer the questions which the understanding asks. The soul answers never by\\nwords, but by the thing itself that is inquired after.', 'Revelation is the disclosure of the soul. The popular notion of a revelation is\\nthat it is a telling of fortunes. In past oracles of the soul the understanding\\nseeks to find answers to sensual questions, and undertakes to tell from God how\\nlong men shall exist, what their hands shall do and who shall be their company,\\nadding names and dates and places. But we must pick no locks. We must check\\nthis low curiosity. An answer in words is delusive; it is really no answer to\\nthe questions you ask. Do not require a description of the countries towards\\nwhich you sail. The description does not describe them to you, and to-morrow\\nyou arrive there and know them by inhabiting them. Men ask concerning the\\nimmortality of the soul, the employments of heaven, the state of the sinner,\\nand so forth. They even dream that Jesus has left replies to precisely these\\ninterrogatories. Never a moment did that sublime spirit speak in their\\npatois. To truth, justice, love, the attributes of the soul, the idea of\\nimmutableness is essentially associated. Jesus, living in these moral\\nsentiments, heedless of sensual fortunes, heeding only the manifestations of\\nthese, never made the separation of the idea of duration from the essence of\\nthese attributes, nor uttered a syllable concerning the duration of the soul.\\nIt was left to his disciples to sever duration from the moral elements, and to\\nteach the immortality of the soul as a doctrine, and maintain it by evidences.\\nThe moment the doctrine of the immortality is separately taught, man is already\\nfallen. In the flowing of love, in the adoration of humility, there is no\\nquestion of continuance. No inspired man ever asks this question or condescends\\nto these evidences. For the soul is true to itself, and the man in whom it is\\nshed abroad cannot wander from the present, which is infinite, to a future\\nwhich would be finite.', 'These questions which we lust to ask about the future are a confession of sin.\\nGod has no answer for them. No answer in words can reply to a question of\\nthings. It is not in an arbitrary “decree of God,” but in the\\nnature of man, that a veil shuts down on the facts of to-morrow; for the soul\\nwill not have us read any other cipher than that of cause and effect. By this\\nveil which curtains events it instructs the children of men to live in to-day.\\nThe only mode of obtaining an answer to these questions of the senses is to\\nforego all low curiosity, and, accepting the tide of being which floats us into\\nthe secret of nature, work and live, work and live, and all unawares the\\nadvancing soul has built and forged for itself a new condition, and the\\nquestion and the answer are one.', 'By the same fire, vital, consecrating, celestial, which burns until it shall\\ndissolve all things into the waves and surges of an ocean of light, we see and\\nknow each other, and what spirit each is of. Who can tell the grounds of his\\nknowledge of the character of the several individuals in his circle of friends?\\nNo man. Yet their acts and words do not disappoint him. In that man, though he\\nknew no ill of him, he put no trust. In that other, though they had seldom met,\\nauthentic signs had yet passed, to signify that he might be trusted as one who\\nhad an interest in his own character. We know each other very well,—which\\nof us has been just to himself and whether that which we teach or behold is\\nonly an aspiration or is our honest effort also.', 'We are all discerners of spirits. That diagnosis lies aloft in our life or\\nunconscious power. The intercourse of society, its trade, its religion, its\\nfriendships, its quarrels, is one wide, judicial investigation of character. In\\nfull court, or in small committee, or confronted face to face, accuser and\\naccused, men offer themselves to be judged. Against their will they exhibit\\nthose decisive trifles by which character is read. But who judges? and what?\\nNot our understanding. We do not read them by learning or craft. No; the wisdom\\nof the wise man consists herein, that he does not judge them; he lets them\\njudge themselves and merely reads and records their own verdict.', 'By virtue of this inevitable nature, private will is overpowered, and, maugre\\nour efforts or our imperfections, your genius will speak from you, and mine\\nfrom me. That which we are, we shall teach, not voluntarily but involuntarily.\\nThoughts come into our minds by avenues which we never left open, and thoughts\\ngo out of our minds through avenues which we never voluntarily opened.\\nCharacter teaches over our head. The infallible index of true progress is found\\nin the tone the man takes. Neither his age, nor his breeding, nor company, nor\\nbooks, nor actions, nor talents, nor all together can hinder him from being\\ndeferential to a higher spirit than his own. If he have not found his home in\\nGod, his manners, his forms of speech, the turn of his sentences, the build,\\nshall I say, of all his opinions will involuntarily confess it, let him brave\\nit out how he will. If he have found his centre, the Deity will shine through\\nhim, through all the disguises of ignorance, of ungenial temperament, of\\nunfavorable circumstance. The tone of seeking is one, and the tone of having is\\nanother.', 'The great distinction between teachers sacred or literary,—between poets\\nlike Herbert, and poets like Pope,—between philosophers like Spinoza,\\nKant and Coleridge, and philosophers like Locke, Paley, Mackintosh and\\nStewart,—between men of the world who are reckoned accomplished talkers,\\nand here and there a fervent mystic, prophesying half insane under the\\ninfinitude of his thought,—is that one class speak from within, or\\nfrom experience, as parties and possessors of the fact; and the other class\\nfrom without, as spectators merely, or perhaps as acquainted with the\\nfact on the evidence of third persons. It is of no use to preach to me from\\nwithout. I can do that too easily myself. Jesus speaks always from within, and\\nin a degree that transcends all others. In that is the miracle. I believe\\nbeforehand that it ought so to be. All men stand continually in the expectation\\nof the appearance of such a teacher. But if a man do not speak from within the\\nveil, where the word is one with that it tells of, let him lowly confess it.', 'The same Omniscience flows into the intellect, and makes what we call genius.\\nMuch of the wisdom of the world is not wisdom, and the most illuminated class\\nof men are no doubt superior to literary fame, and are not writers. Among the\\nmultitude of scholars and authors, we feel no hallowing presence; we are\\nsensible of a knack and skill rather than of inspiration; they have a light and\\nknow not whence it comes and call it their own; their talent is some\\nexaggerated faculty, some overgrown member, so that their strength is a\\ndisease. In these instances the intellectual gifts do not make the impression\\nof virtue, but almost of vice; and we feel that a man’s talents stand in\\nthe way of his advancement in truth. But genius is religious. It is a larger\\nimbibing of the common heart. It is not anomalous, but more like and not less\\nlike other men. There is in all great poets a wisdom of humanity which is\\nsuperior to any talents they exercise. The author, the wit, the partisan, the\\nfine gentleman, does not take place of the man. Humanity shines in Homer, in\\nChaucer, in Spenser, in Shakspeare, in Milton. They are content with truth.\\nThey use the positive degree. They seem frigid and phlegmatic to those who have\\nbeen spiced with the frantic passion and violent coloring of inferior but\\npopular writers. For they are poets by the free course which they allow to the\\ninforming soul, which through their eyes beholds again and blesses the things\\nwhich it hath made. The soul is superior to its knowledge, wiser than any of\\nits works. The great poet makes us feel our own wealth, and then we think less\\nof his compositions. His best communication to our mind is to teach us to\\ndespise all he has done. Shakspeare carries us to such a lofty strain of\\nintelligent activity as to suggest a wealth which beggars his own; and we then\\nfeel that the splendid works which he has created, and which in other hours we\\nextol as a sort of self-existent poetry, take no stronger hold of real nature\\nthan the shadow of a passing traveller on the rock. The inspiration which\\nuttered itself in Hamlet and Lear could utter things as good from day to day\\nfor ever. Why then should I make account of Hamlet and Lear, as if we had not\\nthe soul from which they fell as syllables from the tongue?', 'This energy does not descend into individual life on any other condition than\\nentire possession. It comes to the lowly and simple; it comes to whomsoever\\nwill put off what is foreign and proud; it comes as insight; it comes as\\nserenity and grandeur. When we see those whom it inhabits, we are apprised of\\nnew degrees of greatness. From that inspiration the man comes back with a\\nchanged tone. He does not talk with men with an eye to their opinion. He tries\\nthem. It requires of us to be plain and true. The vain traveller attempts to\\nembellish his life by quoting my lord and the prince and the countess, who thus\\nsaid or did to him. The ambitious vulgar show you their spoons and\\nbrooches and rings, and preserve their cards and compliments. The more\\ncultivated, in their account of their own experience, cull out the pleasing,\\npoetic circumstance,—the visit to Rome, the man of genius they saw, the\\nbrilliant friend They know; still further on perhaps the gorgeous landscape,\\nthe mountain lights, the mountain thoughts they enjoyed yesterday,—and so\\nseek to throw a romantic color over their life. But the soul that ascends to\\nworship the great God is plain and true; has no rose-color, no fine friends, no\\nchivalry, no adventures; does not want admiration; dwells in the hour that now\\nis, in the earnest experience of the common day,—by reason of the present\\nmoment and the mere trifle having become porous to thought and bibulous of the\\nsea of light.', 'Converse with a mind that is grandly simple, and literature looks like\\nword-catching. The simplest utterances are worthiest to be written, yet are\\nthey so cheap and so things of course, that in the infinite riches of the soul\\nit is like gathering a few pebbles off the ground, or bottling a little air in\\na phial, when the whole earth and the whole atmosphere are ours. Nothing can\\npass there, or make you one of the circle, but the casting aside your\\ntrappings, and dealing man to man in naked truth, plain confession, and\\nomniscient affirmation.', 'Souls such as these treat you as gods would, walk as gods in the earth,\\naccepting without any admiration your wit, your bounty, your virtue\\neven,—say rather your act of duty, for your virtue they own as their\\nproper blood, royal as themselves, and over-royal, and the father of the gods.\\nBut what rebuke their plain fraternal bearing casts on the mutual flattery with\\nwhich authors solace each other and wound themselves! These flatter not. I do\\nnot wonder that these men go to see Cromwell and Christina and Charles the\\nSecond and James the First and the Grand Turk. For they are, in their own\\nelevation, the fellows of kings, and must feel the servile tone of conversation\\nin the world. They must always be a godsend to princes, for they confront them,\\na king to a king, without ducking or concession, and give a high nature the\\nrefreshment and satisfaction of resistance, of plain humanity, of even\\ncompanionship and of new ideas. They leave them wiser and superior men. Souls\\nlike these make us feel that sincerity is more excellent than flattery. Deal so\\nplainly with man and woman as to constrain the utmost sincerity and destroy all\\nhope of trifling with you. It is the highest compliment you can pay. Their\\n“highest praising,” said Milton, “is not flattery, and their\\nplainest advice is a kind of praising.”', 'Ineffable is the union of man and God in every act of the soul. The simplest\\nperson who in his integrity worships God, becomes God; yet for ever and ever\\nthe influx of this better and universal self is new and unsearchable. It\\ninspires awe and astonishment. How dear, how soothing to man, arises the idea\\nof God, peopling the lonely place, effacing the scars of our mistakes and\\ndisappointments! When we have broken our god of tradition and ceased from our\\ngod of rhetoric, then may God fire the heart with his presence. It is the\\ndoubling of the heart itself, nay, the infinite enlargement of the heart with a\\npower of growth to a new infinity on every side. It inspires in man an\\ninfallible trust. He has not the conviction, but the sight, that the best is\\nthe true, and may in that thought easily dismiss all particular uncertainties\\nand fears, and adjourn to the sure revelation of time the solution of his\\nprivate riddles. He is sure that his welfare is dear to the heart of being. In\\nthe presence of law to his mind he is overflowed with a reliance so universal\\nthat it sweeps away all cherished hopes and the most stable projects of mortal\\ncondition in its flood. He believes that he cannot escape from his good. The\\nthings that are really for thee gravitate to thee. You are running to seek your\\nfriend. Let your feet run, but your mind need not. If you do not find him, will\\nyou not acquiesce that it is best you should not find him? for there is a\\npower, which, as it is in you, is in him also, and could therefore very well\\nbring you together, if it were for the best. You are preparing with eagerness\\nto go and render a service to which your talent and your taste invite you, the\\nlove of men and the hope of fame. Has it not occurred to you that you have no\\nright to go, unless you are equally willing to be prevented from going? O,\\nbelieve, as thou livest, that every sound that is spoken over the round world,\\nwhich thou oughtest to hear, will vibrate on thine ear! Every proverb, every\\nbook, every byword that belongs to thee for aid or comfort, shall surely come\\nhome through open or winding passages. Every friend whom not thy fantastic will\\nbut the great and tender heart in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace.\\nAnd this because the heart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a\\nwall, not an intersection is there anywhere in nature, but one blood rolls\\nuninterruptedly an endless circulation through all men, as the water of the\\nglobe is all one sea, and, truly seen, its tide is one.', 'Let man then learn the revelation of all nature and all thought to his heart;\\nthis, namely; that the Highest dwells with him; that the sources of nature are\\nin his own mind, if the sentiment of duty is there. But if he would know what\\nthe great God speaketh, he must ‘go into his closet and shut the\\ndoor,’ as Jesus said. God will not make himself manifest to cowards. He\\nmust greatly listen to himself, withdrawing himself from all the accents of\\nother men’s devotion. Even their prayers are hurtful to him, until he\\nhave made his own. Our religion vulgarly stands on numbers of believers.\\nWhenever the appeal is made,—no matter how indirectly,—to numbers,\\nproclamation is then and there made that religion is not. He that finds God a\\nsweet enveloping thought to him never counts his company. When I sit in that\\npresence, who shall dare to come in? When I rest in perfect humility, when I\\nburn with pure love, what can Calvin or Swedenborg say?', 'It makes no difference whether the appeal is to numbers or to one. The faith\\nthat stands on authority is not faith. The reliance on authority measures the\\ndecline of religion, the withdrawal of the soul. The position men have given to\\nJesus, now for many centuries of history, is a position of authority. It\\ncharacterizes themselves. It cannot alter the eternal facts. Great is the soul,\\nand plain. It is no flatterer, it is no follower; it never appeals from itself.\\nIt believes in itself. Before the immense possibilities of man all mere\\nexperience, all past biography, however spotless and sainted, shrinks away.\\nBefore that heaven which our presentiments foreshow us, we cannot easily praise\\nany form of life we have seen or read of. We not only affirm that we have few\\ngreat men, but, absolutely speaking, that we have none; that we have no\\nhistory, no record of any character or mode of living that entirely contents\\nus. The saints and demigods whom history worships we are constrained to accept\\nwith a grain of allowance. Though in our lonely hours we draw a new strength\\nout of their memory, yet, pressed on our attention, as they are by the\\nthoughtless and customary, they fatigue and invade. The soul gives itself,\\nalone, original and pure, to the Lonely, Original and Pure, who, on that\\ncondition, gladly inhabits, leads and speaks through it. Then is it glad, young\\nand nimble. It is not wise, but it sees through all things. It is not called\\nreligious, but it is innocent. It calls the light its own, and feels that the\\ngrass grows and the stone falls by a law inferior to, and dependent on, its\\nnature. Behold, it saith, I am born into the great, the universal mind. I, the\\nimperfect, adore my own Perfect. I am somehow receptive of the great soul, and\\nthereby I do Overlook the sun and the stars and feel them to be the fair\\naccidents and effects which change and pass. More and more the surges of\\neverlasting nature enter into me, and I become public and human in my regards\\nand actions. So come I to live in thoughts and act with energies which are\\nimmortal. Thus revering the soul, and learning, as the ancient said, that\\n“its beauty is immense,” man will come to see that the world is the\\nperennial miracle which the soul worketh, and be less astonished at particular\\nwonders; he will learn that there is no profane history; that all history is\\nsacred; that the universe is represented in an atom, in a moment of time. He\\nwill weave no longer a spotted life of shreds and patches, but he will live\\nwith a divine unity. He will cease from what is base and frivolous in his life\\nand be content with all places and with any service he can render. He will\\ncalmly front the morrow in the negligency of that trust which carries God with\\nit and so hath already the whole future in the bottom of the heart.', 'Nature centres into balls,\\nAnd her proud ephemerals,\\nFast to surface and outside,\\nScan the profile of the sphere;\\nKnew they what that signified,\\nA new genesis were here.', 'The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second; and\\nthroughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end.

One\\nmoral we have already deduced, in considering the circular or compensatory\\ncharacter of every human action. Another analogy we shall now trace, that every\\naction admits of being outdone. Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth that\\naround every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in nature, but\\nevery end is a beginning; that there is always another dawn risen on mid-noon,\\nand under every deep a lower deep opens.', 'This fact, as far as it symbolizes the moral fact of the Unattainable, the\\nflying Perfect, around which the hands of man can never meet, at once the\\ninspirer and the condemner of every success, may conveniently serve us to\\nconnect many illustrations of human power in every department.', 'There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and volatile. Permanence\\nis but a word of degrees. Our globe seen by God is a transparent law, not a\\nmass of facts. The law dissolves the fact and holds it fluid. Our culture is\\nthe predominance of an idea which draws after it this train of cities and\\ninstitutions. Let us rise into another idea: they will disappear. The Greek\\nsculpture is all melted away, as if it had been statues of ice; here and there\\na solitary figure or fragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of snow\\nleft in cold dells and mountain clefts in June and July. For the genius that\\ncreated it creates now somewhat else. The Greek letters last a little longer,\\nbut are already passing under the same sentence and tumbling into the\\ninevitable pit which the creation of new thought opens for all that is old. The\\nnew continents are built out of the ruins of an old planet; the new races fed\\nout of the decomposition of the foregoing. New arts destroy the old.

Nature looks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a cause\\nlike all the rest; and when once I comprehend that, will these fields stretch\\nso immovably wide, these leaves hang so individually considerable?

The very hopes of man, the thoughts of his heart, the religion\\nof nations, the manners and morals of mankind are all at the mercy of a new\\ngeneralization. Generalization is always a new influx of the divinity into the\\nmind. Hence the thrill that attends it.', 'Valor consists in the power of self-recovery, so that a man cannot have his\\nflank turned, cannot be out-generalled, but put him where you will, he stands.\\nThis can only be by his preferring truth to his past apprehension of truth, and\\nhis alert acceptance of it from whatever quarter; the intrepid conviction that\\nhis laws, his relations to society, his Christianity, his world, may at any\\ntime be superseded and decease.', 'There are degrees in idealism. We learn first to play with it academically, as\\nthe magnet was once a toy. Then we see in the heyday of youth and poetry that\\nit may be true, that it is true in gleams and fragments. Then its countenance\\nwaxes stern and grand, and we see that it must be true. It now shows itself\\nethical and practical. We learn that God is; that he is in me; and that all\\nthings are shadows of him. The idealism of Berkeley is only a crude statement\\nof the idealism of Jesus, and that again is a crude statement of the fact that\\nall nature is the rapid efflux of goodness executing and organizing itself.\\nMuch more obviously is history and the state of the world at any one time\\ndirectly dependent on the intellectual classification then existing in the\\nminds of men. The things which are dear to men at this hour are so on account\\nof the ideas which have emerged on their mental horizon, and which cause the\\npresent order of things, as a tree bears its apples. A new degree of culture\\nwould instantly revolutionize the entire system of human pursuits.', 'Conversation is a game of circles. In conversation we pluck up the\\ntermini which bound the common of silence on every side. The parties are\\nnot to be judged by the spirit they partake and even express under this\\nPentecost. To-morrow they will have receded from this high-water mark.\\nTo-morrow you shall find them stooping under the old pack-saddles. Yet let us\\nenjoy the cloven flame whilst it glows on our walls. When each new speaker\\nstrikes a new light, emancipates us from the oppression of the last speaker, to\\noppress us with the greatness and exclusiveness of his own thought, then yields\\nus to another redeemer, we seem to recover our rights, to become men. O, what\\ntruths profound and executable only in ages and orbs, are supposed in the\\nannouncement of every truth! In common hours, society sits cold and statuesque.\\nWe all stand waiting, empty,—knowing, possibly, that we can be full,\\nsurrounded by mighty symbols which are not symbols to us, but prose and trivial\\ntoys. Then cometh the god and converts the statues into fiery men, and by a\\nflash of his eye burns up the veil which shrouded all things, and the meaning\\nof the very furniture, of cup and saucer, of chair and clock and tester, is\\nmanifest. The facts which loomed so large in the fogs of\\nyesterday,—property, climate, breeding, personal beauty and the like,\\nhave strangely changed their proportions. All that we reckoned settled shakes\\nand rattles; and literatures, cities, climates, religions, leave their\\nfoundations and dance before our eyes. And yet here again see the swift\\ncircumspection! Good as is discourse, silence is better, and shames it. The\\nlength of the discourse indicates the distance of thought betwixt the speaker\\nand the hearer. If they were at a perfect understanding in any part, no words\\nwould be necessary thereon. If at one in all parts, no words would be suffered.', 'Literature is a point outside of our hodiernal circle through which a new one\\nmay be described. The use of literature is to afford us a platform whence we\\nmay command a view of our present life, a purchase by which we may move it. We\\nfill ourselves with ancient learning, install ourselves the best we can in\\nGreek, in Punic, in Roman houses, only that we may wiselier see French, English\\nand American houses and modes of living. In like manner we see literature best\\nfrom the midst of wild nature, or from the din of affairs, or from a high\\nreligion. The field cannot be well seen from within the field. The astronomer\\nmust have his diameter of the earth’s orbit as a base to find the\\nparallax of any star.', 'Therefore we value the poet. All the argument and all the wisdom is not in the\\nencyclopaedia, or the treatise on metaphysics, or the Body of Divinity, but in\\nthe sonnet or the play. In my daily work I incline to repeat my old steps, and\\ndo not believe in remedial force, in the power of change and reform. But some\\nPetrarch or Ariosto, filled with the new wine of his imagination, writes me an\\node or a brisk romance, full of daring thought and action. He smites and\\narouses me with his shrill tones, breaks up my whole chain of habits, and I\\nopen my eye on my own possibilities. He claps wings to the sides of all the\\nsolid old lumber of the world, and I am capable once more of choosing a\\nstraight path in theory and practice.', 'We have the same need to command a view of the religion of the world. We can\\nnever see Christianity from the catechism:—from the pastures, from a boat\\nin the pond, from amidst the songs of wood-birds we possibly may. Cleansed by\\nthe elemental light and wind, steeped in the sea of beautiful forms which the\\nfield offers us, we may chance to cast a right glance back upon biography.\\nChristianity is rightly dear to the best of mankind; yet was there never a\\nyoung philosopher whose breeding had fallen into the Christian church by whom\\nthat brave text of Paul’s was not specially prized:—“Then\\nshall also the Son be subject unto Him who put all things under him, that God\\nmay be all in all.” Let the claims and virtues of persons be never so\\ngreat and welcome, the instinct of man presses eagerly onward to the impersonal\\nand illimitable, and gladly arms itself against the dogmatism of bigots with\\nthis generous word out of the book itself.', 'The natural world may be conceived of as a system of concentric circles, and we\\nnow and then detect in nature slight dislocations which apprise us that this\\nsurface on which we now stand is not fixed, but sliding. These manifold\\ntenacious qualities, this chemistry and vegetation, these metals and animals,\\nwhich seem to stand there for their own sake, are means and methods\\nonly,—are words of God, and as fugitive as other words. Has the\\nnaturalist or chemist learned his craft, who has explored the gravity of atoms\\nand the elective affinities, who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof\\nthis is only a partial or approximate statement, namely that like draws to\\nlike, and that the goods which belong to you gravitate to you and need not be\\npursued with pains and cost? Yet is that statement approximate also, and not\\nfinal. Omnipresence is a higher fact. Not through subtle subterranean channels\\nneed friend and fact be drawn to their counterpart, but, rightly considered,\\nthese things proceed from the eternal generation of the soul. Cause and effect\\nare two sides of one fact.', 'The same law of eternal procession ranges all that we call the virtues, and\\nextinguishes each in the light of a better. The great man will not be prudent\\nin the popular sense; all his prudence will be so much deduction from his\\ngrandeur. But it behooves each to see, when he sacrifices prudence, to what god\\nhe devotes it; if to ease and pleasure, he had better be prudent still; if to a\\ngreat trust, he can well spare his mule and panniers who has a winged chariot\\ninstead. Geoffrey draws on his boots to go through the woods, that his feet may\\nbe safer from the bite of snakes; Aaron never thinks of such a peril. In many\\nyears neither is harmed by such an accident. Yet it seems to me that with every\\nprecaution you take against such an evil you put yourself into the power of the\\nevil. I suppose that the highest prudence is the lowest prudence. Is this too\\nsudden a rushing from the centre to the verge of our orbit? Think how many\\ntimes we shall fall back into pitiful calculations before we take up our rest\\nin the great sentiment, or make the verge of to-day the new centre. Besides,\\nyour bravest sentiment is familiar to the humblest men.

One man thinks justice consists\\nin paying debts, and has no measure in his abhorrence of another who is very\\nremiss in this duty and makes the creditor wait tediously. But that second man\\nhas his own way of looking at things; asks himself Which debt must I pay first,\\nthe debt to the rich, or the debt to the poor? the debt of money, or the debt\\nof thought to mankind, of genius to nature? For you, O broker, there is no\\nother principle but arithmetic. For me, commerce is of trivial import; love,\\nfaith, truth of character, the aspiration of man, these are sacred; nor can I\\ndetach one duty, like you, from all other duties, and concentrate my forces\\nmechanically on the payment of moneys. Let me live onward; you shall find that,\\nthough slower, the progress of my character will liquidate all these debts\\nwithout injustice to higher claims.

Intellect separates the fact considered,\\nfrom you, from all local and personal reference, and discerns it as if it\\nexisted for its own sake. Heraclitus looked upon the affections as dense and\\ncolored mists. In the fog of good and evil affections it is hard for man to\\nwalk forward in a straight line. Intellect is void of affection and sees an\\nobject as it stands in the light of science, cool and disengaged.

He who is immersed in what\\nconcerns person or place cannot see the problem of existence. This the\\nintellect always ponders. Nature shows all things formed and bound. The\\nintellect pierces the form, overleaps the wall, detects intrinsic likeness\\nbetween remote things and reduces all things into a few principles.', 'The making a fact the subject of thought raises it. All that mass of mental and\\nmoral phenomena which we do not make objects of voluntary thought, come within\\nthe power of fortune; they constitute the circumstance of daily life; they are\\nsubject to change, to fear, and hope. Every man beholds his human condition\\nwith a degree of melancholy. As a ship aground is battered by the waves, so\\nman, imprisoned in mortal life, lies open to the mercy of coming events. But a\\ntruth, separated by the intellect, is no longer a subject of destiny. We behold\\nit as a god upraised above care and fear. And so any fact in our life, or any\\nrecord of our fancies or reflections, disentangled from the web of our\\nunconsciousness, becomes an object impersonal and immortal.

By and\\nby we fall out of that rapture, bethink us where we have been, what we have\\nseen, and repeat as truly as we can what we have beheld.

It seems, for the time, to\\ninherit all that has yet existed and to dictate to the unborn. It affects every\\nthought of man and goes to fashion every institution. But to make it available\\nit needs a vehicle or art by which it is conveyed to men. To be communicable it\\nmust become picture or sensible object. We must learn the language of facts.\\nThe most wonderful inspirations die with their subject if he has no hand to\\npaint them to the senses. The ray of light passes invisible through space and\\nonly when it falls on an object is it seen. When the spiritual energy is\\ndirected on something outward, then it is a thought. The relation between it\\nand you first makes you, the value of you, apparent to me. The rich inventive\\ngenius of the painter must be smothered and lost for want of the power of\\ndrawing, and in our happy hours we should be inexhaustible poets if once we\\ncould break through the silence into adequate rhyme. As all men have some\\naccess to primary truth, so all have some art or power of communication in\\ntheir head, but only in the artist does it descend into the hand. There is an\\ninequality, whose laws we do not yet know, between two men and between two\\nmoments of the same man, in respect to this faculty. In common hours we have\\nthe same facts as in the uncommon or inspired, but they do not sit for their\\nportraits; they are not detached, but lie in a web. The thought of genius is\\nspontaneous; but the power of picture or expression, in the most enriched and\\nflowing nature, implies a mixture of will, a certain control over the\\nspontaneous states, without which no production is possible. It is a conversion\\nof all nature into the rhetoric of thought, under the eye of judgment, with a\\nstrenuous exercise of choice. And yet the imaginative vocabulary seems to be\\nspontaneous also. It does not flow from experience only or mainly, but from a\\nricher source. Not by any conscious imitation of particular forms are the grand\\nstrokes of the painter executed, but by repairing to the fountain-head of all\\nforms in his mind. Who is the first drawing-master? Without instruction we know\\nvery well the ideal of the human form. A child knows if an arm or a leg be\\ndistorted in a picture; if the attitude be natural or grand or mean; though he\\nhas never received any instruction in drawing or heard any conversation on the\\nsubject, nor can himself draw with correctness a single feature. A good form\\nstrikes all eyes pleasantly, long before they have any science on the subject,\\nand a beautiful face sets twenty hearts in palpitation, prior to all\\nconsideration of the mechanical proportions of the features and head. We may\\nowe to dreams some light on the fountain of this skill; for as soon as we let\\nour will go and let the unconscious states ensue, see what cunning draughtsmen\\nwe are! We entertain ourselves with wonderful forms of men, of women, of\\nanimals, of gardens, of woods and of monsters, and the mystic pencil wherewith\\nwe then draw has no awkwardness or inexperience, no meagreness or poverty; it\\ncan design well and group well; its composition is full of art, its colors are\\nwell laid on and the whole canvas which it paints is lifelike and apt to touch\\nus with terror, with tenderness, with desire and with grief. Neither are the\\nartist’s copies from experience ever mere copies, but always touched and\\nsoftened by tints from this ideal domain.', 'The conditions essential to a constructive mind do not appear to be so often\\ncombined but that a good sentence or verse remains fresh and memorable for a\\nlong time. Yet when we write with ease and come out into the free air of\\nthought, we seem to be assured that nothing is easier than to continue this\\ncommunication at pleasure. Up, down, around, the kingdom of thought has no\\ninclosures, but the Muse makes us free of her city. Well, the world has a\\nmillion writers. One would think then that good thought would be as familiar as\\nair and water, and the gifts of each new hour would exclude the last. Yet we\\ncan count all our good books; nay, I remember any beautiful verse for twenty\\nyears. It is true that the discerning intellect of the world is always much in\\nadvance of the creative, so that there are many competent judges of the best\\nbook, and few writers of the best books. But some of the conditions of\\nintellectual construction are of rare occurrence. The intellect is a whole and\\ndemands integrity in every work. This is resisted equally by a man’s\\ndevotion to a single thought and by his ambition to combine too many.', 'Truth is our element of life, yet if a man fasten his attention on a single\\naspect of truth and apply himself to that alone for a long time, the truth\\nbecomes distorted and not itself but falsehood; herein resembling the air,\\nwhich is our natural element, and the breath of our nostrils, but if a stream\\nof the same be directed on the body for a time, it causes cold, fever, and even\\ndeath. How wearisome the grammarian, the phrenologist, the political or\\nreligious fanatic, or indeed any possessed mortal whose balance is lost by the\\nexaggeration of a single topic. It is incipient insanity. Every thought is a\\nprison also. I cannot see what you see, because I am caught up by a strong wind\\nand blown so far in one direction that I am out of the hoop of your horizon.', 'Is it any better if the student, to avoid this offence, and to liberalize\\nhimself, aims to make a mechanical whole of history, or science, or philosophy,\\nby a numerical addition of all the facts that fall within his vision? The world\\nrefuses to be analyzed by addition and subtraction. When we are young we spend\\nmuch time and pains in filling our note-books with all definitions of Religion,\\nLove, Poetry, Politics, Art, in the hope that in the course of a few years we\\nshall have condensed into our encyclopaedia the net value of all the theories\\nat which the world has yet arrived. But year after year our tables get no\\ncompleteness, and at last we discover that our curve is a parabola, whose arcs\\nwill never meet.', 'Neither by detachment neither by aggregation is the integrity of the intellect\\ntransmitted to its works, but by a vigilance which brings the intellect in its\\ngreatness and best state to operate every moment. It must have the same\\nwholeness which nature has. Although no diligence can rebuild the universe in a\\nmodel by the best accumulation or disposition of details, yet does the world\\nreappear in miniature in every event, so that all the laws of nature may be\\nread in the smallest fact. The intellect must have the like perfection in its\\napprehension and in its works. For this reason, an index or mercury of\\nintellectual proficiency is the perception of identity. We talk with\\naccomplished persons who appear to be strangers in nature. The cloud, the tree,\\nthe turf, the bird are not theirs, have nothing of them; the world is only\\ntheir lodging and table. But the poet, whose verses are to be spheral and\\ncomplete, is one whom Nature cannot deceive, whatsoever face of strangeness she\\nmay put on. He feels a strict consanguinity, and detects more likeness than\\nvariety in all her changes. We are stung by the desire for new thought; but\\nwhen we receive a new thought it is only the old thought with a new face, and\\nthough we make it our own we instantly crave another; we are not really\\nenriched. For the truth was in us before it was reflected to us from natural\\nobjects; and the profound genius will cast the likeness of all creatures into\\nevery product of his wit.', 'But if the constructive powers are rare and it is given to few men to be poets,\\nyet every man is a receiver of this descending holy ghost, and may well study\\nthe laws of its influx. Exactly parallel is the whole rule of intellectual duty\\nto the rule of moral duty. A self-denial no less austere than the saint’s\\nis demanded of the scholar. He must worship truth, and forego all things for\\nthat, and choose defeat and pain, so that his treasure in thought is thereby\\naugmented.', 'God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose. Take which you\\nplease,—you can never have both. Between these, as a pendulum, man\\noscillates. He in whom the love of repose predominates will accept the first\\ncreed, the first philosophy, the first political party he meets,—most\\nlikely his father’s. He gets rest, commodity, and reputation; but he\\nshuts the door of truth. He in whom the love of truth predominates will keep\\nhimself aloof from all moorings, and afloat. He will abstain from dogmatism,\\nand recognize all the opposite negations between which, as walls, his being is\\nswung. He submits to the inconvenience of suspense and imperfect opinion, but\\nhe is a candidate for truth, as the other is not, and respects the highest law\\nof his being.', 'The circle of the green earth he must measure with his shoes to find the man\\nwho can yield him truth. He shall then know that there is somewhat more blessed\\nand great in hearing than in speaking. Happy is the hearing man; unhappy the\\nspeaking man. As long as I hear truth I am bathed by a beautiful element and am\\nnot conscious of any limits to my nature. The suggestions are thousandfold that\\nI hear and see. The waters of the great deep have ingress and egress to the\\nsoul. But if I speak, I define, I confine and am less. When Socrates speaks,\\nLysis and Menexenus are afflicted by no shame that they do not speak. They also\\nare good. He likewise defers to them, loves them, whilst he speaks. Because a\\ntrue and natural man contains and is the same truth which an eloquent man\\narticulates; but in the eloquent man, because he can articulate it, it seems\\nsomething the less to reside, and he turns to these silent beautiful with the\\nmore inclination and respect. The ancient sentence said, Let us be silent, for\\nso are the gods. Silence is a solvent that destroys personality, and gives us\\nleave to be great and universal. Every man’s progress is through a\\nsuccession of teachers, each of whom seems at the time to have a superlative\\ninfluence, but it at last gives place to a new. Frankly let him accept it all.\\nJesus says, Leave father, mother, house and lands, and follow me. Who leaves\\nall, receives more. This is as true intellectually as morally. Each new mind we\\napproach seems to require an abdication of all our past and present\\npossessions. A new doctrine seems at first a subversion of all our opinions,\\ntastes, and manner of living. Such has Swedenborg, such has Kant, such has\\nColeridge, such has Hegel or his interpreter Cousin seemed to many young men in\\nthis country. Take thankfully and heartily all they can give. Exhaust them,\\nwrestle with them, let them not go until their blessing be won, and after a\\nshort season the dismay will be overpast, the excess of influence withdrawn,\\nand they will be no longer an alarming meteor, but one more bright star shining\\nserenely in your heaven and blending its light with all your day.', 'But whilst he gives himself up unreservedly to that which draws him, because\\nthat is his own, he is to refuse himself to that which draws him not,\\nwhatsoever fame and authority may attend it, because it is not his own. Entire\\nself-reliance belongs to the intellect. One soul is a counterpoise of all\\nsouls, as a capillary column of water is a balance for the sea. It must treat\\nthings and books and sovereign genius as itself also a sovereign. If Æschylus\\nbe that man he is taken for, he has not yet done his office when he has\\neducated the learned of Europe for a thousand years. He is now to approve\\nhimself a master of delight to me also. If he cannot do that, all his fame\\nshall avail him nothing with me. I were a fool not to sacrifice a thousand\\nÆschyluses to my intellectual integrity. Especially take the same ground in\\nregard to abstract truth, the science of the mind. The Bacon, the Spinoza, the\\nHume, Schelling, Kant, or whosoever propounds to you a philosophy of the mind,\\nis only a more or less awkward translator of things in your consciousness which\\nyou have also your way of seeing, perhaps of denominating. Say then, instead of\\ntoo timidly poring into his obscure sense, that he has not succeeded in\\nrendering back to you your consciousness. He has not succeeded; now let another\\ntry. If Plato cannot, perhaps Spinoza will. If Spinoza cannot, then perhaps\\nKant. Anyhow, when at last it is done, you will find it is no recondite, but a\\nsimple, natural, common state which the writer restores to you.', 'But let us end these didactics. I will not, though the subject might provoke\\nit, speak to the open question between Truth and Love. I shall not presume to\\ninterfere in the old politics of the skies;—“The cherubim know\\nmost; the seraphim love most.” The gods shall settle their own quarrels.\\nBut I cannot recite, even thus rudely, laws of the intellect, without\\nremembering that lofty and sequestered class of men who have been its prophets\\nand oracles, the high-priesthood of the pure reason, the Trismegisti,\\nthe expounders of the principles of thought from age to age. When at long\\nintervals we turn over their abstruse pages, wonderful seems the calm and grand\\nair of these few, these great spiritual lords who have walked in the\\nworld,—these of the old religion,—dwelling in a worship which makes\\nthe sanctities of Christianity look parvenues and popular; for\\n“persuasion is in soul, but necessity is in intellect.” This band\\nof grandees, Hermes, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Plato, Plotinus, Olympiodorus,\\nProclus, Synesius and the rest, have somewhat so vast in their logic, so\\nprimary in their thinking, that it seems antecedent to all the ordinary\\ndistinctions of rhetoric and literature, and to be at once poetry and music and\\ndancing and astronomy and mathematics. I am present at the sowing of the seed\\nof the world. With a geometry of sunbeams the soul lays the foundations of\\nnature. The truth and grandeur of their thought is proved by its scope and\\napplicability, for it commands the entire schedule and inventory of things for\\nits illustration. But what marks its elevation and has even a comic look to us,\\nis the innocent serenity with which these babe-like Jupiters sit in their\\nclouds, and from age to age prattle to each other and to no contemporary. Well\\nassured that their speech is intelligible and the most natural thing in the\\nworld, they add thesis to thesis, without a moment’s heed of the\\nuniversal astonishment of the human race below, who do not comprehend their\\nplainest argument; nor do they ever relent so much as to insert a popular or\\nexplaining sentence, nor testify the least displeasure or petulance at the\\ndulness of their amazed auditory. The angels are so enamored of the language\\nthat is spoken in heaven that they will not distort their lips with the hissing\\nand unmusical dialects of men, but speak their own, whether there be any who\\nunderstand it or not.', 'Give to barrows trays and pans\\nGrace and glimmer of romance,\\nBring the moonlight into noon\\nHid in gleaming piles of stone;\\nOn the city’s paved street\\nPlant gardens lined with lilac sweet,\\nLet spouting fountains cool the air,\\nSinging in the sun-baked square.\\nLet statue, picture, park and hall,\\nBallad, flag and festival,\\nThe past restore, the day adorn\\nAnd make each morrow a new morn\\nSo shall the drudge in dusty frock\\nSpy behind the city clock\\nRetinues of airy kings,\\nSkirts of angels, starry wings,\\nHis fathers shining in bright fables,\\nHis children fed at heavenly tables.\\n’Tis the privilege of Art\\nThus to play its cheerful part,\\nMan in Earth to acclimate\\nAnd bend the exile to his fate,\\nAnd, moulded of one element\\nWith the days and firmament,\\nTeach him on these as stairs to climb\\nAnd live on even terms with Time;\\nWhilst upper life the slender rill\\nOf human sense doth overfill.', 'Because the soul is progressive, it never quite repeats itself, but in every\\nact attempts the production of a new and fairer whole. This appears in works\\nboth of the useful and the fine arts, if we employ the popular distinction of\\nworks according to their aim either at use or beauty. Thus in our fine arts,\\nnot imitation but creation is the aim. In landscapes the painter should give\\nthe suggestion of a fairer creation than we know. The details, the prose of\\nnature he should omit and give us only the spirit and splendor. He should know\\nthat the landscape has beauty for his eye because it expresses a thought which\\nis to him good; and this because the same power which sees through his eyes is\\nseen in that spectacle; and he will come to value the expression of nature and\\nnot nature itself, and so exalt in his copy the features that please him. He\\nwill give the gloom of gloom and the sunshine of sunshine. In a portrait he\\nmust inscribe the character and not the features, and must esteem the man who\\nsits to him as himself only an imperfect picture or likeness of the aspiring\\noriginal within.', 'What is that abridgment and selection we observe in all spiritual activity, but\\nitself the creative impulse? for it is the inlet of that higher illumination\\nwhich teaches to convey a larger sense by simpler symbols. What is a man but\\nnature’s finer success in self-explication? What is a man but a finer and\\ncompacter landscape than the horizon figures,—nature’s eclecticism?\\nand what is his speech, his love of painting, love of nature, but a still finer\\nsuccess,—all the weary miles and tons of space and bulk left out, and the\\nspirit or moral of it contracted into a musical word, or the most cunning\\nstroke of the pencil?', 'But the artist must employ the symbols in use in his day and nation to convey\\nhis enlarged sense to his fellow-men. Thus the new in art is always formed out\\nof the old. The Genius of the Hour sets his ineffaceable seal on the work and\\ngives it an inexpressible charm for the imagination. As far as the spiritual\\ncharacter of the period overpowers the artist and finds expression in his work,\\nso far it will retain a certain grandeur, and will represent to future\\nbeholders the Unknown, the Inevitable, the Divine. No man can quite exclude\\nthis element of Necessity from his labor. No man can quite emancipate himself\\nfrom his age and country, or produce a model in which the education, the\\nreligion, the politics, usages and arts of his times shall have no share.\\nThough he were never so original, never so wilful and fantastic, he cannot wipe\\nout of his work every trace of the thoughts amidst which it grew. The very\\navoidance betrays the usage he avoids. Above his will and out of his sight he\\nis necessitated by the air he breathes and the idea on which he and his\\ncontemporaries live and toil, to share the manner of his times, without knowing\\nwhat that manner is. Now that which is inevitable in the work has a higher\\ncharm than individual talent can ever give, inasmuch as the artist’s pen\\nor chisel seems to have been held and guided by a gigantic hand to inscribe a\\nline in the history of the human race. This circumstance gives a value to the\\nEgyptian hieroglyphics, to the Indian, Chinese and Mexican idols, however gross\\nand shapeless. They denote the height of the human soul in that hour, and were\\nnot fantastic, but sprung from a necessity as deep as the world. Shall I now\\nadd that the whole extant product of the plastic arts has herein its highest\\nvalue, as history; as a stroke drawn in the portrait of that fate,\\nperfect and beautiful, according to whose ordinations all beings advance to\\ntheir beatitude?', 'Thus, historically viewed, it has been the office of art to educate the\\nperception of beauty. We are immersed in beauty, but our eyes have no clear\\nvision. It needs, by the exhibition of single traits, to assist and lead the\\ndormant taste. We carve and paint, or we behold what is carved and painted, as\\nstudents of the mystery of Form. The virtue of art lies in detachment, in\\nsequestering one object from the embarrassing variety. Until one thing comes\\nout from the connection of things, there can be enjoyment, contemplation, but\\nno thought. Our happiness and unhappiness are unproductive. The infant lies in\\na pleasing trance, but his individual character and his practical power depend\\non his daily progress in the separation of things, and dealing with one at a\\ntime. Love and all the passions concentrate all existence around a single form.\\nIt is the habit of certain minds to give an all-excluding fulness to the\\nobject, the thought, the word, they alight upon, and to make that for the time\\nthe deputy of the world. These are the artists, the orators, the leaders of\\nsociety. The power to detach and to magnify by detaching is the essence of\\nrhetoric in the hands of the orator and the poet. This rhetoric, or power to\\nfix the momentary eminency of an object,—so remarkable in Burke, in\\nByron, in Carlyle,—the painter and sculptor exhibit in color and in\\nstone. The power depends on the depth of the artist’s insight of that\\nobject he contemplates. For every object has its roots in central nature, and\\nmay of course be so exhibited to us as to represent the world. Therefore each\\nwork of genius is the tyrant of the hour and concentrates attention on itself.\\nFor the time, it is the only thing worth naming to do that,—be it a\\nsonnet, an opera, a landscape, a statue, an oration, the plan of a temple, of a\\ncampaign, or of a voyage of discovery. Presently we pass to some other object,\\nwhich rounds itself into a whole as did the first; for example a well-laid\\ngarden; and nothing seems worth doing but the laying out of gardens. I should\\nthink fire the best thing in the world, if I were not acquainted with air, and\\nwater, and earth. For it is the right and property of all natural objects, of\\nall genuine talents, of all native properties whatsoever, to be for their\\nmoment the top of the world. A squirrel leaping from bough to bough and making\\nthe Wood but one wide tree for his pleasure, fills the eye not less than a\\nlion,—is beautiful, self-sufficing, and stands then and there for nature.\\nA good ballad draws my ear and heart whilst I listen, as much as an epic has\\ndone before. A dog, drawn by a master, or a litter of pigs, satisfies and is a\\nreality not less than the frescoes of Angelo. From this succession of excellent\\nobjects we learn at last the immensity of the world, the opulence of human\\nnature, which can run out to infinitude in any direction. But I also learn that\\nwhat astonished and fascinated me in the first work astonished me in the second\\nwork also; that excellence of all things is one.', 'The office of painting and sculpture seems to be merely initial. The best\\npictures can easily tell us their last secret. The best pictures are rude\\ndraughts of a few of the miraculous dots and lines and dyes which make up the\\never-changing “landscape with figures” amidst which we dwell.\\nPainting seems to be to the eye what dancing is to the limbs. When that has\\neducated the frame to self-possession, to nimbleness, to grace, the steps of\\nthe dancing-master are better forgotten; so painting teaches me the splendor of\\ncolor and the expression of form, and as I see many pictures and higher genius\\nin the art, I see the boundless opulence of the pencil, the indifferency in\\nwhich the artist stands free to choose out of the possible forms. If he can\\ndraw every thing, why draw any thing? and then is my eye opened to the eternal\\npicture which nature paints in the street, with moving men and children,\\nbeggars and fine ladies, draped in red and green and blue and gray;\\nlong-haired, grizzled, white-faced, black-faced, wrinkled, giant, dwarf,\\nexpanded, elfish,—capped and based by heaven, earth and sea.', 'A gallery of sculpture teaches more austerely the same lesson. As picture\\nteaches the coloring, so sculpture the anatomy of form. When I have seen fine\\nstatues and afterwards enter a public assembly, I understand well what he meant\\nwho said, “When I have been reading Homer, all men look like\\ngiants.” I too see that painting and sculpture are gymnastics of the eye,\\nits training to the niceties and curiosities of its function. There is no\\nstatue like this living man, with his infinite advantage over all ideal\\nsculpture, of perpetual variety. What a gallery of art have I here! No\\nmannerist made these varied groups and diverse original single figures. Here is\\nthe artist himself improvising, grim and glad, at his block. Now one thought\\nstrikes him, now another, and with each moment he alters the whole air,\\nattitude and expression of his clay. Away with your nonsense of oil and easels,\\nof marble and chisels; except to open your eyes to the masteries of eternal\\nart, they are hypocritical rubbish.', 'The reference of all production at last to an aboriginal Power explains the\\ntraits common to all works of the highest art,—that they are universally\\nintelligible; that they restore to us the simplest states of mind, and are\\nreligious. Since what skill is therein shown is the reappearance of the\\noriginal soul, a jet of pure light, it should produce a similar impression to\\nthat made by natural objects. In happy hours, nature appears to us one with\\nart; art perfected,—the work of genius. And the individual, in whom\\nsimple tastes and susceptibility to all the great human influences overpower\\nthe accidents of a local and special culture, is the best critic of art. Though\\nwe travel the world over to find the beautiful, we must carry it with us, or we\\nfind it not. The best of beauty is a finer charm than skill in surfaces, in\\noutlines, or rules of art can ever teach, namely a radiation from the work of\\nart of human character,—a wonderful expression through stone, or canvas,\\nor musical sound, of the deepest and simplest attributes of our nature, and\\ntherefore most intelligible at last to those souls which have these attributes.\\nIn the sculptures of the Greeks, in the masonry of the Romans, and in the\\npictures of the Tuscan and Venetian masters, the highest charm is the universal\\nlanguage they speak. A confession of moral nature, of purity, love, and hope,\\nbreathes from them all. That which we carry to them, the same we bring back\\nmore fairly illustrated in the memory. The traveller who visits the Vatican,\\nand passes from chamber to chamber through galleries of statues, vases,\\nsarcophagi and candelabra, through all forms of beauty cut in the richest\\nmaterials, is in danger of forgetting the simplicity of the principles out of\\nwhich they all sprung, and that they had their origin from thoughts and laws in\\nhis own breast. He studies the technical rules on these wonderful remains, but\\nforgets that these works were not always thus constellated; that they are the\\ncontributions of many ages and many countries; that each came out of the\\nsolitary workshop of one artist, who toiled perhaps in ignorance of the\\nexistence of other sculpture, created his work without other model save life,\\nhousehold life, and the sweet and smart of personal relations, of beating\\nhearts, and meeting eyes; of poverty and necessity and hope and fear. These\\nwere his inspirations, and these are the effects he carries home to your heart\\nand mind. In proportion to his force, the artist will find in his work an\\noutlet for his proper character. He must not be in any manner pinched or\\nhindered by his material, but through his necessity of imparting himself the\\nadamant will be wax in his hands, and will allow an adequate communication of\\nhimself, in his full stature and proportion. He need not cumber himself with a\\nconventional nature and culture, nor ask what is the mode in Rome or in Paris,\\nbut that house and weather and manner of living which poverty and the fate of\\nbirth have made at once so odious and so dear, in the gray unpainted wood\\ncabin, on the corner of a New Hampshire farm, or in the log-hut of the\\nbackwoods, or in the narrow lodging where he has endured the constraints and\\nseeming of a city poverty, will serve as well as any other condition as the\\nsymbol of a thought which pours itself indifferently through all.', 'I remember when in my younger days I had heard of the wonders of Italian\\npainting, I fancied the great pictures would be great strangers; some\\nsurprising combination of color and form; a foreign wonder, barbaric pearl and\\ngold, like the spontoons and standards of the militia, which play such pranks\\nin the eyes and imaginations of school-boys. I was to see and acquire I knew\\nnot what. When I came at last to Rome and saw with eyes the pictures, I found\\nthat genius left to novices the gay and fantastic and ostentatious, and itself\\npierced directly to the simple and true; that it was familiar and sincere; that\\nit was the old, eternal fact I had met already in so many forms,—unto\\nwhich I lived; that it was the plain you and me I knew so\\nwell,—had left at home in so many conversations. I had the same\\nexperience already in a church at Naples. There I saw that nothing was changed\\nwith me but the place, and said to myself—‘Thou foolish child, hast\\nthou come out hither, over four thousand miles of salt water, to find that\\nwhich was perfect to thee there at home?’ That fact I saw again in the\\nAcademmia at Naples, in the chambers of sculpture, and yet again when I came to\\nRome and to the paintings of Raphael, Angelo, Sacchi, Titian, and Leonardo da\\nVinci. “What, old mole! workest thou in the earth so fast?” It had\\ntravelled by my side; that which I fancied I had left in Boston was here in the\\nVatican, and again at Milan and at Paris, and made all travelling ridiculous as\\na treadmill. I now require this of all pictures, that they domesticate me, not\\nthat they dazzle me. Pictures must not be too picturesque. Nothing astonishes\\nmen so much as common-sense and plain dealing. All great actions have been\\nsimple, and all great pictures are.', 'The Transfiguration, by Raphael, is an eminent example of this peculiar merit.\\nA calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture, and goes directly to the\\nheart. It seems almost to call you by name. The sweet and sublime face of Jesus\\nis beyond praise, yet how it disappoints all florid expectations! This\\nfamiliar, simple, home-speaking countenance is as if one should meet a friend.\\nThe knowledge of picture-dealers has its value, but listen not to their\\ncriticism when your heart is touched by genius. It was not painted for them, it\\nwas painted for you; for such as had eyes capable of being touched by\\nsimplicity and lofty emotions.', 'Yet when we have said all our fine things about the arts, we must end with a\\nfrank confession, that the arts, as we know them, are but initial. Our best\\npraise is given to what they aimed and promised, not to the actual result. He\\nhas conceived meanly of the resources of man, who believes that the best age of\\nproduction is past. The real value of the Iliad or the Transfiguration is as\\nsigns of power; billows or ripples they are of the stream of tendency; tokens\\nof the everlasting effort to produce, which even in its worst estate the soul\\nbetrays. Art has not yet come to its maturity if it do not put itself abreast\\nwith the most potent influences of the world, if it is not practical and moral,\\nif it do not stand in connection with the conscience, if it do not make the\\npoor and uncultivated feel that it addresses them with a voice of lofty cheer.\\nThere is higher work for Art than the arts. They are abortive births of an\\nimperfect or vitiated instinct. Art is the need to create; but in its essence,\\nimmense and universal, it is impatient of working with lame or tied hands, and\\nof making cripples and monsters, such as all pictures and statues are. Nothing\\nless than the creation of man and nature is its end. A man should find in it an\\noutlet for his whole energy. He may paint and carve only as long as he can do\\nthat. Art should exhilarate, and throw down the walls of circumstance on every\\nside, awakening in the beholder the same sense of universal relation and power\\nwhich the work evinced in the artist, and its highest effect is to make new\\nartists.', 'Already History is old enough to witness the old age and disappearance of\\nparticular arts. The art of sculpture is long ago perished to any real effect.\\nIt was originally a useful art, a mode of writing, a savage’s record of\\ngratitude or devotion, and among a people possessed of a wonderful perception\\nof form this childish carving was refined to the utmost splendor of effect. But\\nit is the game of a rude and youthful people, and not the manly labor of a wise\\nand spiritual nation. Under an oak-tree loaded with leaves and nuts, under a\\nsky full of eternal eyes, I stand in a thoroughfare; but in the works of our\\nplastic arts and especially of sculpture, creation is driven into a corner. I\\ncannot hide from myself that there is a certain appearance of paltriness, as of\\ntoys and the trumpery of a theatre, in sculpture. Nature transcends all our\\nmoods of thought, and its secret we do not yet find. But the gallery stands at\\nthe mercy of our moods, and there is a moment when it becomes frivolous. I do\\nnot wonder that Newton, with an attention habitually engaged on the paths of\\nplanets and suns, should have wondered what the Earl of Pembroke found to\\nadmire in “stone dolls.” Sculpture may serve to teach the pupil how\\ndeep is the secret of form, how purely the spirit can translate its meanings\\ninto that eloquent dialect. But the statue will look cold and false before that\\nnew activity which needs to roll through all things, and is impatient of\\ncounterfeits and things not alive. Picture and sculpture are the celebrations\\nand festivities of form. But true art is never fixed, but always flowing. The\\nsweetest music is not in the oratorio, but in the human voice when it speaks\\nfrom its instant life tones of tenderness, truth, or courage. The oratorio has\\nalready lost its relation to the morning, to the sun, and the earth, but that\\npersuading voice is in tune with these. All works of art should not be\\ndetached, but extempore performances. A great man is a new statue in every\\nattitude and action. A beautiful woman is a picture which drives all beholders\\nnobly mad. Life may be lyric or epic, as well as a poem or a romance.', 'A true announcement of the law of creation, if a man were found worthy to\\ndeclare it, would carry art up into the kingdom of nature, and destroy its\\nseparate and contrasted existence. The fountains of invention and beauty in\\nmodern society are all but dried up. A popular novel, a theatre, or a ball-room\\nmakes us feel that we are all paupers in the alms-house of this world, without\\ndignity, without skill or industry. Art is as poor and low. The old tragic\\nNecessity, which lowers on the brows even of the Venuses and the Cupids of the\\nantique, and furnishes the sole apology for the intrusion of such anomalous\\nfigures into nature,—namely, that they were inevitable; that the artist\\nwas drunk with a passion for form which he could not resist, and which vented\\nitself in these fine extravagances,—no longer dignifies the chisel or the\\npencil. But the artist and the connoisseur now seek in art the exhibition of\\ntheir talent, or an asylum from the evils of life. Men are not well pleased\\nwith the figure they make in their own imaginations, and they flee to art, and\\nconvey their better sense in an oratorio, a statue, or a picture. Art makes the\\nsame effort which a sensual prosperity makes; namely to detach the beautiful\\nfrom the useful, to do up the work as unavoidable, and, hating it, pass on to\\nenjoyment. These solaces and compensations, this division of beauty from use,\\nthe laws of nature do not permit. As soon as beauty is sought, not from\\nreligion and love but for pleasure, it degrades the seeker. High beauty is no\\nlonger attainable by him in canvas or in stone, in sound, or in lyrical\\nconstruction; an effeminate, prudent, sickly beauty, which is not beauty, is\\nall that can be formed; for the hand can never execute any thing higher than\\nthe character can inspire.', 'The art that thus separates is itself first separated. Art must not be a\\nsuperficial talent, but must begin farther back in man. Now men do not see\\nnature to be beautiful, and they go to make a statue which shall be. They abhor\\nmen as tasteless, dull, and inconvertible, and console themselves with\\ncolor-bags and blocks of marble. They reject life as prosaic, and create a\\ndeath which they call poetic. They despatch the day’s weary chores, and\\nfly to voluptuous reveries. They eat and drink, that they may afterwards\\nexecute the ideal. Thus is art vilified; the name conveys to the mind its\\nsecondary and bad senses; it stands in the imagination as somewhat contrary to\\nnature, and struck with death from the first. Would it not be better to begin\\nhigher up,—to serve the ideal before they eat and drink; to serve the\\nideal in eating and drinking, in drawing the breath, and in the functions of\\nlife? Beauty must come back to the useful arts, and the distinction between the\\nfine and the useful arts be forgotten. If history were truly told, if life were\\nnobly spent, it would be no longer easy or possible to distinguish the one from\\nthe other. In nature, all is useful, all is beautiful. It is therefore\\nbeautiful because it is alive, moving, reproductive; it is therefore useful\\nbecause it is symmetrical and fair. Beauty will not come at the call of a\\nlegislature, nor will it repeat in England or America its history in Greece. It\\nwill come, as always, unannounced, and spring up between the feet of brave and\\nearnest men. It is in vain that we look for genius to reiterate its miracles in\\nthe old arts; it is its instinct to find beauty and holiness in new and\\nnecessary facts, in the field and road-side, in the shop and mill. Proceeding\\nfrom a religious heart it will raise to a divine use the railroad, the\\ninsurance office, the joint-stock company; our law, our primary assemblies, our\\ncommerce, the galvanic battery, the electric jar, the prism, and the\\nchemist’s retort; in which we seek now only an economical use. Is not the\\nselfish and even cruel aspect which belongs to our great mechanical works, to\\nmills, railways, and machinery, the effect of the mercenary impulses which\\nthese works obey? When its errands are noble and adequate, a steamboat bridging\\nthe Atlantic between Old and New England and arriving at its ports with the\\npunctuality of a planet, is a step of man into harmony with nature. The boat at\\nSt. Petersburg, which plies along the Lena by magnetism, needs little to make\\nit sublime. When science is learned in love, and its powers are wielded by\\nlove, they will appear the supplements and continuations of the material\\ncreation.', ''], ['NEW EDITION', 'BOSTON & CAMBRIDGE:\\nJAMES MUNROE AND COMPANY\\nM DCCC XLIX.', \"Entered, according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1849\\nBy JAMES MUNROE AND COMPANY,\\nin the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of Massachusetts.\", 'BOSTON:\\nTHURSTON, TORRY AND COMPANY,\\n31 Devonshire Street.', 'CONTENTS', 'INTRODUCTION.', 'OUR age is retrospective. It builds the sepulchres of the fathers. It writes\\nbiographies, histories, and criticism. The foregoing generations beheld God and\\nnature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we also enjoy an\\noriginal relation to the universe? Why should not we have a poetry and\\nphilosophy of insight and not of tradition, and a religion by revelation to us,\\nand not the history of theirs? Embosomed for a season in nature, whose floods of\\nlife stream around and through us, and invite us by the powers they supply, to\\naction proportioned to nature, why should we grope among the dry bones of the\\npast, or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe?\\nThe sun shines to-day also. There is more wool and flax in the fields. There are\\nnew lands, new men, new thoughts. Let us demand our own works and laws and\\nworship.', \"Undoubtedly we have no questions to ask which are unanswerable. We must trust\\nthe perfection of the creation so far, as to believe that whatever curiosity the\\norder of things has awakened in our minds, the order of things can satisfy.\\nEvery man's condition is a solution in hieroglyphic to those inquiries he would\\nput. He acts it as life, before he apprehends it as truth. In like manner,\\nnature is already, in its forms and tendencies, describing its own design. Let\\nus interrogate the great apparition, that shines so peacefully around us. Let us\\ninquire, to what end is nature?\", 'All science has one aim, namely, to find a theory of nature. We have theories\\nof races and of functions, but scarcely yet a remote approach to an idea of\\ncreation. We are now so far from the road to truth, that religious teachers\\ndispute and hate each other, and speculative men are esteemed unsound and\\nfrivolous. But to a sound judgment, the most abstract truth is the most\\npractical. Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test\\nis, that it will explain all phenomena. Now many are thought not only\\nunexplained but inexplicable; as language, sleep, madness, dreams, beasts, sex.', 'Philosophically considered, the universe is composed of Nature and the Soul.\\nStrictly speaking, therefore, all that is separate from us, all which Philosophy\\ndistinguishes as the NOT ME, that is, both nature and art, all other men and my\\nown body, must be ranked under this name, NATURE. In enumerating the values of\\nnature and casting up their sum, I shall use the word in both senses;—in its\\ncommon and in its philosophical import. In inquiries so general as our present\\none, the inaccuracy is not material; no confusion of thought will occur. \\nNature, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by man; space, the\\nair, the river, the leaf. Art is applied to the mixture of his will with\\nthe same things, as in a house, a canal, a statue, a picture. But his operations\\ntaken together are so insignificant, a little chipping, baking, patching, and\\nwashing, that in an impression so grand as that of the world on the human mind,\\nthey do not vary the result.', 'NATURE.', 'CHAPTER I.', 'TO go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from\\nsociety. I am not solitary whilst I read and write, though nobody is with me.\\nBut if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from\\nthose heavenly worlds, will separate between him and what he touches. One might\\nthink the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the\\nheavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of\\ncities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand\\nyears, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the\\nremembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out\\nthese envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.', 'The stars awaken a certain reverence, because though always present, they are\\ninaccessible; but all natural objects make a kindred impression, when the mind\\nis open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does\\nthe wisest man extort her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her\\nperfection. Nature never became a toy to a wise spirit. The flowers, the\\nanimals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they\\nhad delighted the simplicity of his childhood.', \"When we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical\\nsense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by manifold natural\\nobjects. It is this which distinguishes the stick of timber of the wood-cutter,\\nfrom the tree of the poet. The charming landscape which I saw this morning, is\\nindubitably made up of some twenty or thirty farms. Miller owns this field,\\nLocke that, and Manning the woodland beyond. But none of them owns the\\nlandscape. There is a property in the horizon which no man has but he whose eye\\ncan integrate all the parts, that is, the poet. This is the best part of these\\nmen's farms, yet to this their warranty-deeds give no title.\", 'To speak truly, few adult persons can see nature. Most persons do not see the\\nsun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the\\neye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child. The lover of\\nnature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each\\nother; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. His\\nintercourse with heaven and earth, becomes part of his daily food. In the\\npresence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real\\nsorrows. Nature says,—he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs,\\nhe shall be glad with me. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and\\nseason yields its tribute of delight; for every hour and change corresponds to\\nand authorizes a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest\\nmidnight. Nature is a setting that fits equally well a comic or a mourning\\npiece. In good health, the air is a cordial of incredible virtue. Crossing a\\nbare common, in snow puddles, at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having\\nin my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect\\nexhilaration. I am glad to the brink of fear. In the woods too, a man casts off\\nhis years, as the snake his slough, and at what period soever of life, is always\\na child. In the woods, is perpetual youth. Within these plantations of God, a\\ndecorum and sanctity reign, a perennial festival is dressed, and the guest sees\\nnot how he should tire of them in a thousand years. In the woods, we return to\\nreason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,—no disgrace,\\nno calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the\\nbare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite\\nspace,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing;\\nI see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part\\nor particle of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and\\naccidental: to be brothers, to be acquaintances,—master or servant, is then a\\ntrifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In\\nthe wilderness, I find something more dear and connate than in streets or\\nvillages. In the tranquil landscape, and especially in the distant line of the\\nhorizon, man beholds somewhat as beautiful as his own nature.', 'The greatest delight which the fields and woods minister, is the suggestion\\nof an occult relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and\\nunacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the boughs in the\\nstorm, is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown.\\nIts effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me,\\nwhen I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.', 'Yet it is certain that the power to produce this delight, does not reside in\\nnature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these\\npleasures with great temperance. For, nature is not always tricked in holiday\\nattire, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume and glittered as for\\nthe frolic of the nymphs, is overspread with melancholy today. Nature always\\nwears the colors of the spirit. To a man laboring under calamity, the heat of\\nhis own fire hath sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the\\nlandscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less\\ngrand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.', 'CHAPTER II.', 'COMMODITY.', 'WHOEVER considers the final cause of the world, will discern a multitude of\\nuses that result. They all admit of being thrown into one of the following\\nclasses; Commodity; Beauty; Language; and Discipline.', 'Under the general name of Commodity, I rank all those advantages which our\\nsenses owe to nature. This, of course, is a benefit which is temporary and\\nmediate, not ultimate, like its service to the soul. Yet although low, it is\\nperfect in its kind, and is the only use of nature which all men apprehend. The\\nmisery of man appears like childish petulance, when we explore the steady and\\nprodigal provision that has been made for his support and delight on this green\\nball which floats him through the heavens. What angels invented these splendid\\nornaments, these rich conveniences, this ocean of air above, this ocean of water\\nbeneath, this firmament of earth between? this zodiac of lights, this tent of\\ndropping clouds, this striped coat of climates, this fourfold year? Beasts,\\nfire, water, stones, and corn serve him. The field is at once his floor, his\\nwork-yard, his play-ground, his garden, and his bed.', '\"More servants wait on man\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Than he\\'ll take notice of.\"—', \"Nature, in its ministry to man, is not only the material, but is also the\\nprocess and the result. All the parts incessantly work into each other's hands\\nfor the profit of man. The wind sows the seed; the sun evaporates the sea; the\\nwind blows the vapor to the field; the ice, on the other side of the planet,\\ncondenses rain on this; the rain feeds the plant; the plant feeds the animal;\\nand thus the endless circulations of the divine charity nourish man.\", \"The useful arts are reproductions or new combinations by the wit of man, of\\nthe same natural benefactors. He no longer waits for favoring gales, but by\\nmeans of steam, he realizes the fable of Aeolus's bag, and carries the two and\\nthirty winds in the boiler of his boat. To diminish friction, he paves the road\\nwith iron bars, and, mounting a coach with a ship-load of men, animals, and\\nmerchandise behind him, he darts through the country, from town to town, like an\\neagle or a swallow through the air. By the aggregate of these aids, how is the\\nface of the world changed, from the era of Noah to that of Napoleon! The private\\npoor man hath cities, ships, canals, bridges, built for him. He goes to the\\npost-office, and the human race run on his errands; to the book-shop, and the\\nhuman race read and write of all that happens, for him; to the court-house, and\\nnations repair his wrongs. He sets his house upon the road, and the human race\\ngo forth every morning, and shovel out the snow, and cut a path for him.\", \"But there is no need of specifying particulars in this class of uses. The\\ncatalogue is endless, and the examples so obvious, that I shall leave them to\\nthe reader's reflection, with the general remark, that this mercenary benefit is\\none which has respect to a farther good. A man is fed, not that he may be fed,\\nbut that he may work.\", 'CHAPTER III.', 'BEAUTY.', 'A NOBLER want of man is served by nature, namely, the love of Beauty.', \"The ancient Greeks called the world κοσμος, beauty. Such is the constitution of all\\nthings, or such the plastic power of the human eye, that the primary forms, as\\nthe sky, the mountain, the tree, the animal, give us a delight in and for\\nthemselves; a pleasure arising from outline, color, motion, and grouping.\\nThis seems partly owing to the eye itself. The eye is the best of artists. By\\nthe mutual action of its structure and of the laws of light, perspective is\\nproduced, which integrates every mass of objects, of what character soever, into\\na well colored and shaded globe, so that where the particular objects are mean\\nand unaffecting, the landscape which they compose, is round and symmetrical. And\\nas the eye is the best composer, so light is the first of painters. There is no\\nobject so foul that intense light will not make beautiful. And the stimulus it\\naffords to the sense, and a sort of infinitude which it hath, like space and\\ntime, make all matter gay. Even the corpse has its own beauty. But besides this\\ngeneral grace diffused over nature, almost all the individual forms are\\nagreeable to the eye, as is proved by our endless imitations of some of them, as\\nthe acorn, the grape, the pine-cone, the wheat-ear, the egg, the wings and forms\\nof most birds, the lion's claw, the serpent, the butterfly, sea-shells, flames,\\nclouds, buds, leaves, and the forms of many trees, as the palm.\", 'For better consideration, we may distribute the aspects of Beauty in a\\nthreefold manner.', '1. First, the simple perception of natural forms is a delight. The influence\\nof the forms and actions in nature, is so needful to man, that, in its lowest\\nfunctions, it seems to lie on the confines of commodity and beauty. To the body\\nand mind which have been cramped by noxious work or company, nature is medicinal\\nand restores their tone. The tradesman, the attorney comes out of the din and\\ncraft of the street, and sees the sky and the woods, and is a man again. In\\ntheir eternal calm, he finds himself. The health of the eye seems to demand a\\nhorizon. We are never tired, so long as we can see far enough.', 'But in other hours, Nature satisfies by its loveliness, and without any\\nmixture of corporeal benefit. I see the spectacle of morning from the hill-top\\nover against my house, from day-break to sun-rise, with emotions which an angel\\nmight share. The long slender bars of cloud float like fishes in the sea of\\ncrimson light. From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I\\nseem to partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my\\ndust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind. How does Nature deify us\\nwith a few and cheap elements! Give me health and a day, and I will make the\\npomp of emperors ridiculous. The dawn is my Assyria; the sun-set and moon-rise\\nmy Paphos, and unimaginable realms of faerie; broad noon shall be my England of\\nthe senses and the understanding; the night shall be my Germany of mystic\\nphilosophy and dreams.', 'Not less excellent, except for our less susceptibility in the afternoon, was\\nthe charm, last evening, of a January sunset. The western clouds divided and\\nsubdivided themselves into pink flakes modulated with tints of unspeakable\\nsoftness; and the air had so much life and sweetness, that it was a pain to come\\nwithin doors. What was it that nature would say? Was there no meaning in the\\nlive repose of the valley behind the mill, and which Homer or Shakspeare could\\nnot reform for me in words? The leafless trees become spires of flame in the\\nsunset, with the blue east for their back-ground, and the stars of the dead\\ncalices of flowers, and every withered stem and stubble rimed with frost,\\ncontribute something to the mute music.', 'The inhabitants of cities suppose that the country landscape is pleasant only\\nhalf the year. I please myself with the graces of the winter scenery, and\\nbelieve that we are as much touched by it as by the genial influences of summer.\\nTo the attentive eye, each moment of the year has its own beauty, and in the\\nsame field, it beholds, every hour, a picture which was never seen before, and\\nwhich shall never be seen again. The heavens change every moment, and reflect\\ntheir glory or gloom on the plains beneath. The state of the crop in the\\nsurrounding farms alters the expression of the earth from week to week. The\\nsuccession of native plants in the pastures and roadsides, which makes the\\nsilent clock by which time tells the summer hours, will make even the divisions\\nof the day sensible to a keen observer. The tribes of birds and insects, like\\nthe plants punctual to their time, follow each other, and the year has room for\\nall. By water-courses, the variety is greater. In July, the blue pontederia or\\npickerel-weed blooms in large beds in the shallow parts of our pleasant river,\\nand swarms with yellow butterflies in continual motion. Art cannot rival this\\npomp of purple and gold. Indeed the river is a perpetual gala, and boasts each\\nmonth a new ornament.', \"But this beauty of Nature which is seen and felt as beauty, is the least\\npart. The shows of day, the dewy morning, the rainbow, mountains, orchards in\\nblossom, stars, moonlight, shadows in still water, and the like, if too eagerly\\nhunted, become shows merely, and mock us with their unreality. Go out of the\\nhouse to see the moon, and 't is mere tinsel; it will not please as when its\\nlight shines upon your necessary journey. The beauty that shimmers in the yellow\\nafternoons of October, who ever could clutch it? Go forth to find it, and it is\\ngone: 't is only a mirage as you look from the windows of diligence.\", '2. The presence of a higher, namely, of the spiritual element is essential to\\nits perfection. The high and divine beauty which can be loved without\\neffeminacy, is that which is found in combination with the human will. Beauty is\\nthe mark God sets upon virtue. Every natural action is graceful. Every heroic\\nact is also decent, and causes the place and the bystanders to shine. We are\\ntaught by great actions that the universe is the property of every individual in\\nit. Every rational creature has all nature for his dowry and estate. It is his,\\nif he will. He may divest himself of it; he may creep into a corner, and\\nabdicate his kingdom, as most men do, but he is entitled to the world by his\\nconstitution. In proportion to the energy of his thought and will, he takes up\\nthe world into himself. \"All those things for which men plough, build, or sail,\\nobey virtue;\" said Sallust. \"The winds and waves,\" said Gibbon, \"are always on\\nthe side of the ablest navigators.\" So are the sun and moon and all the stars of\\nheaven. When a noble act is done,—perchance in a scene of great natural beauty;\\nwhen Leonidas and his three hundred martyrs consume one day in dying, and the\\nsun and moon come each and look at them once in the steep defile of Thermopylae;\\nwhen Arnold Winkelried, in the high Alps, under the shadow of the avalanche,\\ngathers in his side a sheaf of Austrian spears to break the line for his\\ncomrades; are not these heroes entitled to add the beauty of the scene to the\\nbeauty of the deed? When the bark of Columbus nears the shore of America;—before\\nit, the beach lined with savages, fleeing out of all their huts of cane; the sea\\nbehind; and the purple mountains of the Indian Archipelago around, can we\\nseparate the man from the living picture? Does not the New World clothe his form\\nwith her palm-groves and savannahs as fit drapery? Ever does natural beauty\\nsteal in like air, and envelope great actions. When Sir Harry Vane was dragged\\nup the Tower-hill, sitting on a sled, to suffer death, as the champion of the\\nEnglish laws, one of the multitude cried out to him, \"You never sate on so\\nglorious a seat.\" Charles II., to intimidate the citizens of London, caused the\\npatriot Lord Russel to be drawn in an open coach, through the principal streets\\nof the city, on his way to the scaffold. \"But,\" his biographer says, \"the\\nmultitude imagined they saw liberty and virtue sitting by his side.\" In private\\nplaces, among sordid objects, an act of truth or heroism seems at once to draw\\nto itself the sky as its temple, the sun as its candle. Nature stretcheth out\\nher arms to embrace man, only let his thoughts be of equal greatness. Willingly\\ndoes she follow his steps with the rose and the violet, and bend her lines of\\ngrandeur and grace to the decoration of her darling child. Only let his thoughts\\nbe of equal scope, and the frame will suit the picture. A virtuous man is in\\nunison with her works, and makes the central figure of the visible sphere.\\nHomer, Pindar, Socrates, Phocion, associate themselves fitly in our memory with\\nthe geography and climate of Greece. The visible heavens and earth sympathize\\nwith Jesus. And in common life, whosoever has seen a person of powerful\\ncharacter and happy genius, will have remarked how easily he took all things\\nalong with him,—the persons, the opinions, and the day, and nature became\\nancillary to a man.', '3. There is still another aspect under which the beauty of the world may be\\nviewed, namely, as it becomes an object of the intellect. Beside the relation of\\nthings to virtue, they have a relation to thought. The intellect searches out\\nthe absolute order of things as they stand in the mind of God, and without the\\ncolors of affection. The intellectual and the active powers seem to succeed each\\nother, and the exclusive activity of the one, generates the exclusive activity\\nof the other. There is something unfriendly in each to the other, but they are\\nlike the alternate periods of feeding and working in animals; each prepares and\\nwill be followed by the other. Therefore does beauty, which, in relation to\\nactions, as we have seen, comes unsought, and comes because it is unsought,\\nremain for the apprehension and pursuit of the intellect; and then again, in its\\nturn, of the active power. Nothing divine dies. All good is eternally\\nreproductive. The beauty of nature reforms itself in the mind, and not for\\nbarren contemplation, but for new creation.', 'All men are in some degree impressed by the face of the world; some men even\\nto delight. This love of beauty is Taste. Others have the same love in such\\nexcess, that, not content with admiring, they seek to embody it in new forms.\\nThe creation of beauty is Art.', 'The production of a work of art throws a light upon the mystery of humanity.\\nA work of art is an abstract or epitome of the world. It is the result or\\nexpression of nature, in miniature. For, although the works of nature are\\ninnumerable and all different, the result or the expression of them all is\\nsimilar and single. Nature is a sea of forms radically alike and even unique. A\\nleaf, a sun-beam, a landscape, the ocean, make an analogous impression on the\\nmind. What is common to them all,—that perfectness and harmony, is beauty. The\\nstandard of beauty is the entire circuit of natural forms,—the totality of\\nnature; which the Italians expressed by defining beauty \"il piu nell\\' uno.\"\\nNothing is quite beautiful alone: nothing but is beautiful in the whole. A\\nsingle object is only so far beautiful as it suggests this universal grace. The\\npoet, the painter, the sculptor, the musician, the architect, seek each to\\nconcentrate this radiance of the world on one point, and each in his several\\nwork to satisfy the love of beauty which stimulates him to produce. Thus is Art,\\na nature passed through the alembic of man. Thus in art, does nature work\\nthrough the will of a man filled with the beauty of her first works.', 'The world thus exists to the soul to satisfy the desire of beauty. This\\nelement I call an ultimate end. No reason can be asked or given why the soul\\nseeks beauty. Beauty, in its largest and profoundest sense, is one expression\\nfor the universe. God is the all-fair. Truth, and goodness, and beauty, are but\\ndifferent faces of the same All. But beauty in nature is not ultimate. It is the\\nherald of inward and eternal beauty, and is not alone a solid and satisfactory\\ngood. It must stand as a part, and not as yet the last or highest expression of\\nthe final cause of Nature.', 'CHAPTER IV.', 'LANGUAGE.', 'LANGUAGE is a third use which Nature subserves to man. Nature is the vehicle,\\nand threefold degree.', '1. Words are signs of natural facts.', '2. Particular natural facts are symbols of particular spiritual facts.', '3. Nature is the symbol of spirit.', '1. Words are signs of natural facts. The use of natural history is to give us\\naid in supernatural history: the use of the outer creation, to give us language\\nfor the beings and changes of the inward creation. Every word which is used to\\nexpress a moral or intellectual fact, if traced to its root, is found to be\\nborrowed from some material appearance. Right means straight; \\nwrong means twisted.\\nSpirit primarily means wind; transgression, the crossing of\\na\\nline; supercilious, the raising of the eyebrow. We say the\\nheart to express emotion, the head to denote thought; and \\nthought\\nand emotion are words borrowed from sensible things, and now appropriated\\nto spiritual nature. Most of the process by which this transformation is made,\\nis hidden from us in the remote time when language was framed; but the same\\ntendency may be daily observed in children. Children and savages use only nouns\\nor names of things, which they convert into verbs, and apply to analogous mental\\nacts.', '2. But this origin of all words that convey a spiritual import,—so\\nconspicuous a fact in the history of language,—is our least debt to nature. It\\nis not words only that are emblematic; it is things which are emblematic. Every\\nnatural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact. Every appearance in nature\\ncorresponds to some state of the mind, and that state of the mind can only be\\ndescribed by presenting that natural appearance as its picture. An enraged man\\nis a lion, a cunning man is a fox, a firm man is a rock, a learned man is a\\ntorch. A lamb is innocence; a snake is subtle spite; flowers express to us the\\ndelicate affections. Light and darkness are our familiar expression for\\nknowledge and ignorance; and heat for love. Visible distance behind and before\\nus, is respectively our image of memory and hope.', 'Who looks upon a river in a meditative hour, and is not reminded of the flux\\nof all things? Throw a stone into the stream, and the circles that propagate\\nthemselves are the beautiful type of all influence. Man is conscious of a\\nuniversal soul within or behind his individual life, wherein, as in a firmament,\\nthe natures of Justice, Truth, Love, Freedom, arise and shine. This universal\\nsoul, he calls Reason: it is not mine, or thine, or his, but we are its; we are\\nits property and men. And the blue sky in which the private earth is buried, the\\nsky with its eternal calm, and full of everlasting orbs, is the type of Reason.\\nThat which, intellectually considered, we call Reason, considered in relation to\\nnature, we call Spirit. Spirit is the Creator. Spirit hath life in itself. And\\nman in all ages and countries, embodies it in his language, as the FATHER.', 'It is easily seen that there is nothing lucky or capricious in these\\nanalogies, but that they are constant, and pervade nature. These are not the\\ndreams of a few poets, here and there, but man is an analogist, and studies\\nrelations in all objects. He is placed in the centre of beings, and a ray of\\nrelation passes from every other being to him. And neither can man be understood\\nwithout these objects, nor these objects without man. All the facts in natural\\nhistory taken by themselves, have no value, but are barren, like a single sex.\\nBut marry it to human history, and it is full of life. Whole Floras, all\\nLinnaeus\\' and Buffon\\'s volumes, are dry catalogues of facts; but the most\\ntrivial of these facts, the habit of a plant, the organs, or work, or noise of\\nan insect, applied to the illustration of a fact in intellectual philosophy, or,\\nin any way associated to human nature, affects us in the most lively and\\nagreeable manner. The seed of a plant,—to what affecting analogies in the nature\\nof man, is that little fruit made use of, in all discourse, up to the voice of\\nPaul, who calls the human corpse a seed,—\"It is sown a natural body; it is\\nraised a spiritual body.\" The motion of the earth round its axis, and round the\\nsun, makes the day, and the year. These are certain amounts of brute light and\\nheat. But is there no intent of an analogy between man\\'s life and the seasons?\\nAnd do the seasons gain no grandeur or pathos from that analogy? The instincts\\nof the ant are very unimportant, considered as the ant\\'s; but the moment a ray\\nof relation is seen to extend from it to man, and the little drudge is seen to\\nbe a monitor, a little body with a mighty heart, then all its habits, even that\\nsaid to be recently observed, that it never sleeps, become sublime.', 'Because of this radical correspondence between visible things and human\\nthoughts, savages, who have only what is necessary, converse in figures. As we\\ngo back in history, language becomes more picturesque, until its infancy, when\\nit is all poetry; or all spiritual facts are represented by natural symbols. The\\nsame symbols are found to make the original elements of all languages. It has\\nmoreover been observed, that the idioms of all languages approach each other in\\npassages of the greatest eloquence and power. And as this is the first language,\\nso is it the last. This immediate dependence of language upon nature, this\\nconversion of an outward phenomenon into a type of somewhat in human life, never\\nloses its power to affect us. It is this which gives that piquancy to the\\nconversation of a strong-natured farmer or back-woodsman, which all men relish.', \"A man's power to connect his thought with its proper symbol, and so to utter\\nit, depends on the simplicity of his character, that is, upon his love of truth,\\nand his desire to communicate it without loss. The corruption of man is followed\\nby the corruption of language. When simplicity of character and the sovereignty\\nof ideas is broken up by the prevalence of secondary desires, the desire of\\nriches, of pleasure, of power, and of praise,—and duplicity and falsehood take\\nplace of simplicity and truth, the power over nature as an interpreter of the\\nwill, is in a degree lost; new imagery ceases to be created, and old words are\\nperverted to stand for things which are not; a paper currency is employed, when\\nthere is no bullion in the vaults. In due time, the fraud is manifest, and words\\nlose all power to stimulate the understanding or the affections. Hundreds of\\nwriters may be found in every long-civilized nation, who for a short time\\nbelieve, and make others believe, that they see and utter truths, who do not of\\nthemselves clothe one thought in its natural garment, but who feed unconsciously\\non the language created by the primary writers of the country, those, namely,\\nwho hold primarily on nature.\", 'But wise men pierce this rotten diction and fasten words again to visible\\nthings; so that picturesque language is at once a commanding certificate that he\\nwho employs it, is a man in alliance with truth and God. The moment our\\ndiscourse rises above the ground line of familiar facts, and is inflamed with\\npassion or exalted by thought, it clothes itself in images. A man conversing in\\nearnest, if he watch his intellectual processes, will find that a material\\nimage, more or less luminous, arises in his mind, cotemporaneous with every\\nthought, which furnishes the vestment of the thought. Hence, good writing and\\nbrilliant discourse are perpetual allegories. This imagery is spontaneous. It is\\nthe blending of experience with the present action of the mind. It is proper\\ncreation. It is the working of the Original Cause through the instruments he has\\nalready made.', 'These facts may suggest the advantage which the country-life possesses for a\\npowerful mind, over the artificial and curtailed life of cities. We know more\\nfrom nature than we can at will communicate. Its light flows into the mind\\nevermore, and we forget its presence. The poet, the orator, bred in the woods,\\nwhose senses have been nourished by their fair and appeasing changes, year after\\nyear, without design and without heed,—shall not lose their lesson altogether,\\nin the roar of cities or the broil of politics. Long hereafter, amidst agitation\\nand terror in national councils,—in the hour of revolution,—these solemn images\\nshall reappear in their morning lustre, as fit symbols and words of the thoughts\\nwhich the passing events shall awaken. At the call of a noble sentiment, again\\nthe woods wave, the pines murmur, the river rolls and shines, and the cattle low\\nupon the mountains, as he saw and heard them in his infancy. And with these\\nforms, the spells of persuasion, the keys of power are put into his hands.', '3. We are thus assisted by natural objects in the expression of particular\\nmeanings. But how great a language to convey such pepper-corn informations! Did\\nit need such noble races of creatures, this profusion of forms, this host of\\norbs in heaven, to furnish man with the dictionary and grammar of his municipal\\nspeech? Whilst we use this grand cipher to expedite the affairs of our pot and\\nkettle, we feel that we have not yet put it to its use, neither are able. We are\\nlike travellers using the cinders of a volcano to roast their eggs. Whilst we\\nsee that it always stands ready to clothe what we would say, we cannot avoid the\\nquestion, whether the characters are not significant of themselves. Have\\nmountains, and waves, and skies, no significance but what we consciously give\\nthem, when we employ them as emblems of our thoughts? The world is emblematic.\\nParts of speech are metaphors, because the whole of nature is a metaphor of the\\nhuman mind. The laws of moral nature answer to those of matter as face to face\\nin a glass. \"The visible world and the relation of its parts, is the dial plate\\nof the invisible.\" The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics. Thus,\\n\"the whole is greater than its part;\" \"reaction is equal to action;\" \"the\\nsmallest weight may be made to lift the greatest, the difference of weight being\\ncompensated by time;\" and many the like propositions, which have an ethical as\\nwell as physical sense. These propositions have a much more extensive and\\nuniversal sense when applied to human life, than when confined to technical use.', \"In like manner, the memorable words of history, and the proverbs of nations,\\nconsist usually of a natural fact, selected as a picture or parable of a moral\\ntruth. Thus; A rolling stone gathers no moss; A bird in the hand is worth two in\\nthe bush; A cripple in the right way, will beat a racer in the wrong; Make hay\\nwhile the sun shines; 'T is hard to carry a full cup even; Vinegar is the son of\\nwine; The last ounce broke the camel's back; Long-lived trees make roots\\nfirst;—and the like. In their primary sense these are trivial facts, but we\\nrepeat them for the value of their analogical import. What is true of proverbs,\\nis true of all fables, parables, and allegories.\", 'This relation between the mind and matter is not fancied by some poet, but\\nstands in the will of God, and so is free to be known by all men. It appears to\\nmen, or it does not appear. When in fortunate hours we ponder this miracle, the\\nwise man doubts, if, at all other times, he is not blind and deaf;', '—\"Can these things be,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And overcome us like a summer\\'s cloud,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Without our special wonder?\"', 'for the universe becomes transparent, and the light of higher laws than its\\nown, shines through it. It is the standing problem which has exercised the\\nwonder and the study of every fine genius since the world began; from the era of\\nthe Egyptians and the Brahmins, to that of Pythagoras, of Plato, of Bacon, of\\nLeibnitz, of Swedenborg. There sits the Sphinx at the road-side, and from age to\\nage, as each prophet comes by, he tries his fortune at reading her riddle. There\\nseems to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms; and day\\nand night, river and storm, beast and bird, acid and alkali, preexist in\\nnecessary Ideas in the mind of God, and are what they are by virtue of preceding\\naffections, in the world of spirit. A Fact is the end or last issue of spirit.\\nThe visible creation is the terminus or the circumference of the invisible\\nworld. \"Material objects,\" said a French philosopher, \"are necessarily kinds of \\nscoriae\\nof the substantial thoughts of the Creator, which must always preserve an exact\\nrelation to their first origin; in other words, visible nature must have a\\nspiritual and moral side.\"', 'This doctrine is abstruse, and though the images of \"garment,\" \"scoriae,\"\\n\"mirror,\" &c., may stimulate the fancy, we must summon the aid of subtler and\\nmore vital expositors to make it plain. \"Every scripture is to be interpreted by\\nthe same spirit which gave it forth,\"—is the fundamental law of criticism. A\\nlife in harmony with nature, the love of truth and of virtue, will purge the\\neyes to understand her text. By degrees we may come to know the primitive sense\\nof the permanent objects of nature, so that the world shall be to us an open\\nbook, and every form significant of its hidden life and final cause.', 'A new interest surprises us, whilst, under the view now suggested, we\\ncontemplate the fearful extent and multitude of objects; since \"every object\\nrightly seen, unlocks a new faculty of the soul.\" That which was unconscious\\ntruth, becomes, when interpreted and defined in an object, a part of the domain\\nof knowledge,—a new weapon in the magazine of power.', 'CHAPTER V.', 'DISCIPLINE.', 'IN view of the significance of nature, we arrive at once at a new fact, that\\nnature is a discipline. This use of the world includes the preceding uses, as\\nparts of itself.', 'Space, time, society, labor, climate, food, locomotion, the animals, the\\nmechanical forces, give us sincerest lessons, day by day, whose meaning is\\nunlimited. They educate both the Understanding and the Reason. Every property of\\nmatter is a school for the understanding,—its solidity or resistance, its\\ninertia, its extension, its figure, its divisibility. The understanding adds,\\ndivides, combines, measures, and finds nutriment and room for its activity in\\nthis worthy scene. Meantime, Reason transfers all these lessons into its own\\nworld of thought, by perceiving the analogy that marries Matter and Mind.', '1. Nature is a discipline of the understanding in intellectual truths. Our\\ndealing with sensible objects is a constant exercise in the necessary lessons of\\ndifference, of likeness, of order, of being and seeming, of progressive\\narrangement; of ascent from particular to general; of combination to one end of\\nmanifold forces. Proportioned to the importance of the organ to be formed, is\\nthe extreme care with which its tuition is provided,—a care pretermitted in no\\nsingle case. What tedious training, day after day, year after year, never\\nending, to form the common sense; what continual reproduction of annoyances,\\ninconveniences, dilemmas; what rejoicing over us of little men; what disputing\\nof prices, what reckonings of interest,—and all to form the Hand of the mind;—to\\ninstruct us that \"good thoughts are no better than good dreams, unless they be\\nexecuted!\"', 'The same good office is performed by Property and its filial systems of debt\\nand credit. Debt, grinding debt, whose iron face the widow, the orphan, and the\\nsons of genius fear and hate;—debt, which consumes so much time, which so\\ncripples and disheartens a great spirit with cares that seem so base, is a\\npreceptor whose lessons cannot be forgone, and is needed most by those who\\nsuffer from it most. Moreover, property, which has been well compared to\\nsnow,—\"if it fall level to-day, it will be blown into drifts to-morrow,\"—is the\\nsurface action of internal machinery, like the index on the face of a clock.\\nWhilst now it is the gymnastics of the understanding, it is hiving in the\\nforesight of the spirit, experience in profounder laws.', 'The whole character and fortune of the individual are affected by the least\\ninequalities in the culture of the understanding; for example, in the perception\\nof differences. Therefore is Space, and therefore Time, that man may know that\\nthings are not huddled and lumped, but sundered and individual. A bell and a\\nplough have each their use, and neither can do the office of the other. Water is\\ngood to drink, coal to burn, wool to wear; but wool cannot be drunk, nor water\\nspun, nor coal eaten. The wise man shows his wisdom in separation, in gradation,\\nand his scale of creatures and of merits is as wide as nature. The foolish have\\nno range in their scale, but suppose every man is as every other man. What is\\nnot good they call the worst, and what is not hateful, they call the best.', 'In like manner, what good heed, nature forms in us! She pardons no mistakes.\\nHer yea is yea, and her nay, nay.', \"The first steps in Agriculture, Astronomy, Zoölogy, (those first steps which the farmer, the hunter,\\nand the sailor take,) teach that nature's dice are always loaded; that in her\\nheaps and rubbish are concealed sure and useful results.\", 'How calmly and genially the mind apprehends one after another the laws of\\nphysics! What noble emotions dilate the mortal as he enters into the counsels of\\nthe creation, and feels by knowledge the privilege to BE! His insight refines\\nhim. The beauty of nature shines in his own breast. Man is greater that he can\\nsee this, and the universe less, because Time and Space relations vanish as laws\\nare known.', 'Here again we are impressed and even daunted by the immense Universe to be\\nexplored. \"What we know, is a point to what we do not know.\" Open any recent\\njournal of science, and weigh the problems suggested concerning Light, Heat,\\nElectricity, Magnetism, Physiology, Geology, and judge whether the interest of\\nnatural science is likely to be soon exhausted.', 'Passing by many particulars of the discipline of nature, we must not omit to\\nspecify two.', 'The exercise of the Will or the lesson of power is taught in every event.\\nFrom the child\\'s successive possession of his several senses up to the hour when\\nhe saith, \"Thy will be done!\" he is learning the secret, that he can reduce\\nunder his will, not only particular events, but great classes, nay the whole\\nseries of events, and so conform all facts to his character. Nature is\\nthoroughly mediate. It is made to serve. It receives the dominion of man as\\nmeekly as the ass on which the Saviour rode. It offers all its kingdoms to man\\nas the raw material which he may mould into what is useful. Man is never weary\\nof working it up. He forges the subtile and delicate air into wise and melodious\\nwords, and gives them wing as angels of persuasion and command. One after\\nanother, his victorious thought comes up with and reduces all things, until the\\nworld becomes, at last, only a realized will,—the double of the man.', '2. Sensible objects conform to the premonitions of Reason and reflect the\\nconscience. All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an\\nunceasing reference to spiritual nature. Therefore is nature glorious with form,\\ncolor, and motion, that every globe in the remotest heaven; every chemical\\nchange from the rudest crystal up to the laws of life; every change of\\nvegetation from the first principle of growth in the eye of a leaf, to the\\ntropical forest and antediluvian coal-mine; every animal function from the\\nsponge up to Hercules, shall hint or thunder to man the laws of right and wrong,\\nand echo the Ten Commandments. Therefore is nature ever the ally of Religion:\\nlends all her pomp and riches to the religious sentiment. Prophet and priest,\\nDavid, Isaiah, Jesus, have drawn deeply from this source. This ethical character\\nso penetrates the bone and marrow of nature, as to seem the end for which it was\\nmade. Whatever private purpose is answered by any member or part, this is its\\npublic and universal function, and is never omitted. Nothing in nature is\\nexhausted in its first use. When a thing has served an end to the uttermost, it\\nis wholly new for an ulterior service. In God, every end is converted into a new\\nmeans. Thus the use of commodity, regarded by itself, is mean and squalid. But\\nit is to the mind an education in the doctrine of Use, namely, that a thing is\\ngood only so far as it serves; that a conspiring of parts and efforts to the\\nproduction of an end, is essential to any being. The first and gross\\nmanifestation of this truth, is our inevitable and hated training in values and\\nwants, in corn and meat.', 'It has already been illustrated, that every natural process is a version of a\\nmoral sentence. The moral law lies at the centre of nature and radiates to the\\ncircumference. It is the pith and marrow of every substance, every relation, and\\nevery process. All things with which we deal, preach to us. What is a farm but a\\nmute gospel? The chaff and the wheat, weeds and plants, blight, rain, insects,\\nsun,—it is a sacred emblem from the first furrow of spring to the last stack\\nwhich the snow of winter overtakes in the fields. But the sailor, the shepherd,\\nthe miner, the merchant, in their several resorts, have each an experience\\nprecisely parallel, and leading to the same conclusion: because all\\norganizations are radically alike. Nor can it be doubted that this moral\\nsentiment which thus scents the air, grows in the grain, and impregnates the\\nwaters of the world, is caught by man and sinks into his soul. The moral\\ninfluence of nature upon every individual is that amount of truth which it\\nillustrates to him. Who can estimate this? Who can guess how much firmness the\\nsea-beaten rock has taught the fisherman? how much tranquillity has been\\nreflected to man from the azure sky, over whose unspotted deeps the winds\\nforevermore drive flocks of stormy clouds, and leave no wrinkle or stain? how\\nmuch industry and providence and affection we have caught from the pantomime of\\nbrutes? What a searching preacher of self-command is the varying phenomenon of\\nHealth!', 'Herein is especially apprehended the unity of Nature,—the unity in\\nvariety,—which meets us everywhere. All the endless variety of things make an\\nidentical impression. Xenophanes complained in his old age, that, look where he\\nwould, all things hastened back to Unity. He was weary of seeing the same entity\\nin the tedious variety of forms. The fable of Proteus has a cordial truth. A\\nleaf, a drop, a crystal, a moment of time is related to the whole, and partakes\\nof the perfection of the whole. Each particle is a microcosm, and faithfully\\nrenders the likeness of the world.', 'Not only resemblances exist in things whose analogy is obvious, as when we\\ndetect the type of the human hand in the flipper of the fossil saurus, but also\\nin objects wherein there is great superficial unlikeness. Thus architecture is\\ncalled \"frozen music,\" by De Stael and Goethe. Vitruvius thought an architect\\nshould be a musician. \"A Gothic church,\" said Coleridge, \"is a petrified\\nreligion.\" Michael Angelo maintained, that, to an architect, a knowledge of\\nanatomy is essential. In Haydn\\'s oratorios, the notes present to the imagination\\nnot only motions, as, of the snake, the stag, and the elephant, but colors also;\\nas the green grass. The law of harmonic sounds reappears in the harmonic colors.\\nThe granite is differenced in its laws only by the more or less of heat, from\\nthe river that wears it away. The river, as it flows, resembles the air that\\nflows over it; the air resembles the light which traverses it with more subtile\\ncurrents; the light resembles the heat which rides with it through Space. Each\\ncreature is only a modification of the other; the likeness in them is more than\\nthe difference, and their radical law is one and the same. A rule of one art, or\\na law of one organization, holds true throughout nature. So intimate is this\\nUnity, that, it is easily seen, it lies under the undermost garment of nature,\\nand betrays its source in Universal Spirit. For, it pervades Thought also. Every\\nuniversal truth which we express in words, implies or supposes every other\\ntruth. Omne verum vero consonat. It is like a great circle on a sphere,\\ncomprising all possible circles; which, however, may be drawn, and comprise it,\\nin like manner. Every such truth is the absolute Ens seen from one side. But it\\nhas innumerable sides.', 'The central Unity is still more conspicuous in actions. Words are finite\\norgans of the infinite mind. They cannot cover the dimensions of what is in\\ntruth. They break, chop, and impoverish it. An action is the perfection and\\npublication of thought. A right action seems to fill the eye, and to be related\\nto all nature. \"The wise man, in doing one thing, does all; or, in the one thing\\nhe does rightly, he sees the likeness of all which is done rightly.\"', \"Words and actions are not the attributes of brute nature. They introduce us\\nto the human form, of which all other organizations appear to be degradations.\\nWhen this appears among so many that surround it, the spirit prefers it to all\\nothers. It says, 'From such as this, have I drawn joy and knowledge; in such as\\nthis, have I found and beheld myself; I will speak to it; it can speak again; it\\ncan yield me thought already formed and alive.' In fact, the eye,—the mind,—is\\nalways accompanied by these forms, male and female; and these are incomparably\\nthe richest informations of the power and order that lie at the heart of things.\\nUnfortunately, every one of them bears the marks as of some injury; is marred\\nand superficially defective. Nevertheless, far different from the deaf and dumb\\nnature around them, these all rest like fountain-pipes on the unfathomed sea of\\nthought and virtue whereto they alone, of all organizations, are the entrances.\", 'It were a pleasant inquiry to follow into detail their ministry to our\\neducation, but where would it stop? We are associated in adolescent and adult\\nlife with some friends, who, like skies and waters, are coextensive with our\\nidea; who, answering each to a certain affection of the soul, satisfy our desire\\non that side; whom we lack power to put at such focal distance from us, that we\\ncan mend or even analyze them. We cannot choose but love them. When much\\nintercourse with a friend has supplied us with a standard of excellence, and has\\nincreased our respect for the resources of God who thus sends a real person to\\noutgo our ideal; when he has, moreover, become an object of thought, and, whilst\\nhis character retains all its unconscious effect, is converted in the mind into\\nsolid and sweet wisdom,—it is a sign to us that his office is closing, and he is\\ncommonly withdrawn from our sight in a short time.', 'CHAPTER VI.', 'IDEALISM.', 'THUS is the unspeakable but intelligible and practicable meaning of the world\\nconveyed to man, the immortal pupil, in every object of sense. To this one end\\nof Discipline, all parts of nature conspire.', 'A noble doubt perpetually suggests itself, whether this end be not the Final\\nCause of the Universe; and whether nature outwardly exists. It is a sufficient\\naccount of that Appearance we call the World, that God will teach a human mind,\\nand so makes it the receiver of a certain number of congruent sensations, which\\nwe call sun and moon, man and woman, house and trade. In my utter impotence to\\ntest the authenticity of the report of my senses, to know whether the\\nimpressions they make on me correspond with outlying objects, what difference\\ndoes it make, whether Orion is up there in heaven, or some god paints the image\\nin the firmament of the soul? The relations of parts and the end of the whole\\nremaining the same, what is the difference, whether land and sea interact, and\\nworlds revolve and intermingle without number or end,—deep yawning under deep,\\nand galaxy balancing galaxy, throughout absolute space,—or, whether, without\\nrelations of time and space, the same appearances are inscribed in the constant\\nfaith of man? Whether nature enjoy a substantial existence without, or is only\\nin the apocalypse of the mind, it is alike useful and alike venerable to me. Be\\nit what it may, it is ideal to me, so long as I cannot try the accuracy of my\\nsenses.', 'The frivolous make themselves merry with the Ideal theory, if its\\nconsequences were burlesque; as if it affected the stability of nature. It\\nsurely does not. God never jests with us, and will not compromise the end of\\nnature, by permitting any inconsequence in its procession. Any distrust of the\\npermanence of laws, would paralyze the faculties of man. Their permanence is\\nsacredly respected, and his faith therein is perfect. The wheels and springs of\\nman are all set to the hypothesis of the permanence of nature. We are not built\\nlike a ship to be tossed, but like a house to stand. It is a natural consequence\\nof this structure, that, so long as the active powers predominate over the\\nreflective, we resist with indignation any hint that nature is more short-lived\\nor mutable than spirit. The broker, the wheelwright, the carpenter, the\\ntoll-man, are much displeased at the intimation.', 'But whilst we acquiesce entirely in the permanence of natural laws, the\\nquestion of the absolute existence of nature still remains open. It is the\\nuniform effect of culture on the human mind, not to shake our faith in the\\nstability of particular phenomena, as of heat, water, azote; but to lead us to\\nregard nature as a phenomenon, not a substance; to attribute necessary existence\\nto spirit; to esteem nature as an accident and an effect.', 'To the senses and the unrenewed understanding, belongs a sort of instinctive\\nbelief in the absolute existence of nature. In their view, man and nature are\\nindissolubly joined. Things are ultimates, and they never look beyond their\\nsphere. The presence of Reason mars this faith. The first effort of thought\\ntends to relax this despotism of the senses, which binds us to nature as if we\\nwere a part of it, and shows us nature aloof, and, as it were, afloat. Until\\nthis higher agency intervened, the animal eye sees, with wonderful accuracy,\\nsharp outlines and colored surfaces. When the eye of Reason opens, to outline\\nand surface are at once added, grace and expression. These proceed from\\nimagination and affection, and abate somewhat of the angular distinctness of\\nobjects. If the Reason be stimulated to more earnest vision, outlines and\\nsurfaces become transparent, and are no longer seen; causes and spirits are seen\\nthrough them. The best moments of life are these delicious awakenings of the\\nhigher powers, and the reverential withdrawing of nature before its God.', 'Let us proceed to indicate the effects of culture. 1. Our first institution\\nin the Ideal philosophy is a hint from nature herself.', \"Nature is made to conspire with spirit to emancipate us. Certain mechanical\\nchanges, a small alteration in our local position apprizes us of a dualism. We\\nare strangely affected by seeing the shore from a moving ship, from a balloon,\\nor through the tints of an unusual sky. The least change in our point of view,\\ngives the whole world a pictorial air. A man who seldom rides, needs only to get\\ninto a coach and traverse his own town, to turn the street into a puppet-show.\\nThe men, the women,—talking, running, bartering, fighting,—the earnest mechanic,\\nthe lounger, the beggar, the boys, the dogs, are unrealized at once, or, at\\nleast, wholly detached from all relation to the observer, and seen as apparent,\\nnot substantial beings. What new thoughts are suggested by seeing a face of\\ncountry quite familiar, in the rapid movement of the rail-road car! Nay, the\\nmost wonted objects, (make a very slight change in the point of vision,) please\\nus most. In a camera obscura, the butcher's cart, and the figure of one of our\\nown family amuse us. So a portrait of a well-known face gratifies us. Turn the\\neyes upside down, by looking at the landscape through your legs, and how\\nagreeable is the picture, though you have seen it any time these twenty years!\", 'In these cases, by mechanical means, is suggested the difference between the\\nobserver and the spectacle,—between man and nature. Hence arises a pleasure\\nmixed with awe; I may say, a low degree of the sublime is felt from the fact,\\nprobably, that man is hereby apprized, that, whilst the world is a spectacle,\\nsomething in himself is stable.', '2. In a higher manner, the poet communicates the same pleasure. By a few\\nstrokes he delineates, as on air, the sun, the mountain, the camp, the city, the\\nhero, the maiden, not different from what we know them, but only lifted from the\\nground and afloat before the eye. He unfixes the land and the sea, makes them\\nrevolve around the axis of his primary thought, and disposes them anew.\\nPossessed himself by a heroic passion, he uses matter as symbols of it. The\\nsensual man conforms thoughts to things; the poet conforms things to his\\nthoughts. The one esteems nature as rooted and fast; the other, as fluid, and\\nimpresses his being thereon. To him, the refractory world is ductile and\\nflexible; he invests dust and stones with humanity, and makes them the words of\\nthe Reason. The Imagination may be defined to be, the use which the Reason makes\\nof the material world. Shakspeare possesses the power of subordinating nature\\nfor the purposes of expression, beyond all poets. His imperial muse tosses the\\ncreation like a bauble from hand to hand, and uses it to embody any caprice of\\nthought that is upper-most in his mind. The remotest spaces of nature are\\nvisited, and the farthest sundered things are brought together, by a subtle\\nspiritual connection. We are made aware that magnitude of material things is\\nrelative, and all objects shrink and expand to serve the passion of the poet.\\nThus, in his sonnets, the lays of birds, the scents and dyes of flowers, he\\nfinds to be the\\nshadow of his beloved; time, which keeps her from him, is his chest;\\nthe suspicion she has awakened, is her ornament;', \"The ornament of beauty is Suspect,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A crow which flies in heaven's sweetest air.\", 'His passion is not the fruit of chance; it swells, as he speaks, to a city,\\nor a state.', 'No, it was builded far from accident;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Under the brow of thralling discontent;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It fears not policy, that heretic,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 That works on leases of short numbered hours,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But all alone stands hugely politic.', 'In the strength of his constancy, the Pyramids seem to him recent and\\ntransitory. The freshness of youth and love dazzles him with its resemblance to\\nmorning.', 'Take those lips away\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Which so sweetly were forsworn;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And those eyes,—the break of day,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Lights that do mislead the morn.', 'The wild beauty of this hyperbole, I may say, in passing, it would not be\\neasy to match in literature.', 'This transfiguration which all material objects undergo through the passion\\nof the poet,—this power which he exerts to dwarf the great, to magnify the\\nsmall,—might be illustrated by a thousand examples from his Plays. I have before\\nme the Tempest, and will cite only these few lines.', 'ARIEL.

Whilst thus the poet animates nature with his own thoughts, he differs\\nfrom the philosopher only herein, that the one proposes Beauty as his main end;\\nthe other Truth. But the philosopher, not less than the poet, postpones the\\napparent order and relations of things to the empire of thought. \"The problem of\\nphilosophy,\" according to Plato, \"is, for all that exists conditionally, to find\\na ground unconditioned and absolute.\" It proceeds on the faith that a law\\ndetermines all phenomena, which being known, the phenomena can be predicted.\\nThat law, when in the mind, is an idea. Its beauty is infinite. The true\\nphilosopher and the true poet are one, and a beauty, which is truth, and a\\ntruth, which is beauty, is the aim of both. Is not the charm of one of Plato\\'s\\nor Aristotle\\'s definitions, strictly like that of the Antigone of Sophocles? It\\nis, in both cases, that a spiritual life has been imparted to nature; that the\\nsolid seeming block of matter has been pervaded and dissolved by a thought; that\\nthis feeble human being has penetrated the vast masses of nature with an\\ninforming soul, and recognised itself in their harmony, that is, seized their\\nlaw. In physics, when this is attained, the memory disburthens itself of its\\ncumbrous catalogues of particulars, and carries centuries of observation in a\\nsingle formula.', 'Thus even in physics, the material is degraded before the spiritual. The\\nastronomer, the geometer, rely on their irrefragable analysis, and disdain the\\nresults of observation. The sublime remark of Euler on his law of arches, \"This\\nwill be found contrary to all experience, yet is true;\" had already transferred\\nnature into the mind, and left matter like an outcast corpse.', '4. Intellectual science has been observed to beget invariably a doubt of the\\nexistence of matter. Turgot said, \"He that has never doubted the existence of\\nmatter, may be assured he has no aptitude for metaphysical inquiries.\" It\\nfastens the attention upon immortal necessary uncreated natures, that is, upon\\nIdeas; and in their presence, we feel that the outward circumstance is a dream\\nand a shade. Whilst we wait in this Olympus of gods, we think of nature as an\\nappendix to the soul. We ascend into their region, and know that these are the\\nthoughts of the Supreme Being. \"These are they who were set up from everlasting,\\nfrom the beginning, or ever the earth was. When he prepared the heavens, they\\nwere there; when he established the clouds above, when he strengthened the\\nfountains of the deep. Then they were by him, as one brought up with him. Of\\nthem took he counsel.\"', 'Their influence is proportionate. As objects of science, they are accessible\\nto few men. Yet all men are capable of being raised by piety or by passion, into\\ntheir region. And no man touches these divine natures, without becoming, in some\\ndegree, himself divine. Like a new soul, they renew the body. We become\\nphysically nimble and lightsome; we tread on air; life is no longer irksome, and\\nwe think it will never be so. No man fears age or misfortune or death, in their\\nserene company, for he is transported out of the district of change. Whilst we\\nbehold unveiled the nature of Justice and Truth, we learn the difference between\\nthe absolute and the conditional or relative. We apprehend the absolute. As it\\nwere, for the first time, we exist. We become immortal, for we learn that\\ntime and space are relations of matter; that, with a perception of truth, or a\\nvirtuous will, they have no affinity.', '5. Finally, religion and ethics, which may be fitly called,—the practice of\\nideas, or the introduction of ideas into life,—have an analogous effect with all\\nlower culture, in degrading nature and suggesting its dependence on spirit.\\nEthics and religion differ herein; that the one is the system of human duties\\ncommencing from man; the other, from God. Religion includes the personality of\\nGod; Ethics does not. They are one to our present design. They both put nature\\nunder foot. The first and last lesson of religion is, \"The things that are seen,\\nare temporal; the things that are unseen, are eternal.\" It puts an affront upon\\nnature. It does that for the unschooled, which philosophy does for Berkeley and\\nViasa. The uniform language that may be heard in the churches of the most\\nignorant sects, is,—\"Contemn the unsubstantial shows of the world; they are\\nvanities, dreams, shadows, unrealities; seek the realities of religion.\" The\\ndevotee flouts nature. Some theosophists have arrived at a certain hostility and\\nindignation towards matter, as the Manichean and Plotinus. They distrusted in\\nthemselves any looking back to these flesh-pots of Egypt. Plotinus was ashamed\\nof his body. In short, they might all say of matter, what Michael Angelo said of\\nexternal beauty, \"it is the frail and weary weed, in which God dresses the soul,\\nwhich he has called into time.\"', \"It appears that motion, poetry, physical and intellectual science, and\\nreligion, all tend to affect our convictions of the reality of the external\\nworld. But I own there is something ungrateful in expanding too curiously the\\nparticulars of the general proposition, that all culture tends to imbue us with\\nidealism. I have no hostility to nature, but a child's love to it. I expand and\\nlive in the warm day like corn and melons. Let us speak her fair. I do not wish\\nto fling stones at my beautiful mother, nor soil my gentle nest. I only wish to\\nindicate the true position of nature in regard to man, wherein to establish man,\\nall right education tends; as the ground which to attain is the object of human\\nlife, that is, of man's connection with nature. Culture inverts the vulgar views\\nof nature, and brings the mind to call that apparent, which it uses to call\\nreal, and that real, which it uses to call visionary. Children, it is true,\\nbelieve in the external world. The belief that it appears only, is an\\nafterthought, but with culture, this faith will as surely arise on the mind as\\ndid the first.\", 'The advantage of the ideal theory over the popular faith, is this, that it\\npresents the world in precisely that view which is most desirable to the mind.\\nIt is, in fact, the view which Reason, both speculative and practical, that is,\\nphilosophy and virtue, take. For, seen in the light of thought, the world always\\nis phenomenal; and virtue subordinates it to the mind. Idealism sees the world\\nin God. It beholds the whole circle of persons and things, of actions and\\nevents, of country and religion, not as painfully accumulated, atom after atom,\\nact after act, in an aged creeping Past, but as one vast picture, which God\\npaints on the instant eternity, for the contemplation of the soul. Therefore the\\nsoul holds itself off from a too trivial and microscopic study of the universal\\ntablet. It respects the end too much, to immerse itself in the means. It sees\\nsomething more important in Christianity, than the scandals of ecclesiastical\\nhistory, or the niceties of criticism; and, very incurious concerning persons or\\nmiracles, and not at all disturbed by chasms of historical evidence, it accepts\\nfrom God the phenomenon, as it finds it, as the pure and awful form of religion\\nin the world. It is not hot and passionate at the appearance of what it calls\\nits own good or bad fortune, at the union or opposition of other persons. No man\\nis its enemy. It accepts whatsoever befalls, as part of its lesson. It is a\\nwatcher more than a doer, and it is a doer, only that it may the better watch.', 'CHAPTER VII.', 'SPIRIT.', 'IT is essential to a true theory of nature and of man, that it should contain\\nsomewhat progressive. Uses that are exhausted or that may be, and facts that end\\nin the statement, cannot be all that is true of this brave lodging wherein man\\nis harbored, and wherein all his faculties find appropriate and endless\\nexercise. And all the uses of nature admit of being summed in one, which yields\\nthe activity of man an infinite scope. Through all its kingdoms, to the suburbs\\nand outskirts of things, it is faithful to the cause whence it had its origin.\\nIt always speaks of Spirit. It suggests the absolute. It is a perpetual effect.\\nIt is a great shadow pointing always to the sun behind us.', 'The aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with\\nbended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man is he who learns\\nfrom nature the lesson of worship.', 'Of that ineffable essence which we call Spirit, he that thinks most, will say\\nleast. We can foresee God in the coarse, and, as it were, distant phenomena of\\nmatter; but when we try to define and describe himself, both language and\\nthought desert us, and we are as helpless as fools and savages. That essence\\nrefuses to be recorded in propositions, but when man has worshipped him\\nintellectually, the noblest ministry of nature is to stand as the apparition of\\nGod. It is the organ through which the universal spirit speaks to the\\nindividual, and strives to lead back the individual to it.', 'When we consider Spirit, we see that the views already presented do not\\ninclude the whole circumference of man. We must add some related thoughts.', \"Three problems are put by nature to the mind; What is matter? Whence is it?\\nand Whereto? The first of these questions only, the ideal theory answers.\\nIdealism saith: matter is a phenomenon, not a substance. Idealism acquaints us\\nwith the total disparity between the evidence of our own being, and the evidence\\nof the world's being. The one is perfect; the other, incapable of any assurance;\\nthe mind is a part of the nature of things; the world is a divine dream, from\\nwhich we may presently awake to the glories and certainties of day. Idealism is\\na hypothesis to account for nature by other principles than those of carpentry\\nand chemistry. Yet, if it only deny the existence of matter, it does not satisfy\\nthe demands of the spirit. It leaves God out of me. It leaves me in the splendid\\nlabyrinth of my perceptions, to wander without end. Then the heart resists it,\\nbecause it balks the affections in denying substantive being to men and women.\\nNature is so pervaded with human life, that there is something of humanity in\\nall, and in every particular. But this theory makes nature foreign to me, and\\ndoes not account for that consanguinity which we acknowledge to it.\", 'Let it stand, then, in the present state of our knowledge, merely as a useful\\nintroductory hypothesis, serving to apprize us of the eternal distinction\\nbetween the soul and the world.', 'But when, following the invisible steps of thought, we come to inquire,\\nWhence is matter? and Whereto? many truths arise to us out of the recesses of\\nconsciousness. We learn that the highest is present to the soul of man, that the\\ndread universal essence, which is not wisdom, or love, or beauty, or power, but\\nall in one, and each entirely, is that for which all things exist, and that by\\nwhich they are; that spirit creates; that behind nature, throughout nature,\\nspirit is present; one and not compound, it does not act upon us from without,\\nthat is, in space and time, but spiritually, or through ourselves: therefore,\\nthat spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up nature around us, but\\nputs it forth through us, as the life of the tree puts forth new branches and\\nleaves through the pores of the old. As a plant upon the earth, so a man rests\\nupon the bosom of God; he is nourished by unfailing fountains, and draws, at his\\nneed, inexhaustible power. Who can set bounds to the possibilities of man? Once\\ninhale the upper air, being admitted to behold the absolute natures of justice\\nand truth, and we learn that man has access to the entire mind of the Creator,\\nis himself the creator in the finite. This view, which admonishes me where the\\nsources of wisdom and power lie, and points to virtue as to', '\"The golden key\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Which opes the palace of eternity,\"', 'carries upon its face the highest certificate of truth, because it animates\\nme to create my own world through the purification of my soul.', 'The world proceeds from the same spirit as the body of man. It is a remoter\\nand inferior incarnation of God, a projection of God in the unconscious. But it\\ndiffers from the body in one important respect. It is not, like that, now\\nsubjected to the human will. Its serene order is inviolable by us. It is,\\ntherefore, to us, the present expositor of the divine mind. It is a fixed point\\nwhereby we may measure our departure. As we degenerate, the contrast between us\\nand our house is more evident. We are as much strangers in nature, as we are\\naliens from God. We do not understand the notes of birds. The fox and the deer\\nrun away from us; the bear and tiger rend us. We do not know the uses of more\\nthan a few plants, as corn and the apple, the potato and the vine. Is not the\\nlandscape, every glimpse of which hath a grandeur, a face of him? Yet this may\\nshow us what discord is between man and nature, for you cannot freely admire a\\nnoble landscape, if laborers are digging in the field hard by. The poet finds\\nsomething ridiculous in his delight, until he is out of the sight of men.', 'CHAPTER VIII.', 'PROSPECTS.', 'IN inquiries respecting the laws of the world and the frame of things, the\\nhighest reason is always the truest. That which seems faintly possible—it is so\\nrefined, is often faint and dim because it is deepest seated in the mind among\\nthe eternal verities. Empirical science is apt to cloud the sight, and, by the\\nvery knowledge of functions and processes, to bereave the student of the manly\\ncontemplation of the whole. The savant becomes unpoetic. But the best read\\nnaturalist who lends an entire and devout attention to truth, will see that\\nthere remains much to learn of his relation to the world, and that it is not to\\nbe learned by any addition or subtraction or other comparison of known\\nquantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit, by a continual\\nself-recovery, and by entire humility. He will perceive that there are far more\\nexcellent qualities in the student than preciseness and infallibility; that a\\nguess is often more fruitful than an indisputable affirmation, and that a dream\\nmay let us deeper into the secret of nature than a hundred concerted\\nexperiments.', \"For, the problems to be solved are precisely those which the physiologist and\\nthe naturalist omit to state. It is not so pertinent to man to know all the\\nindividuals of the animal kingdom, as it is to know whence and whereto is this\\ntyrannizing unity in his constitution, which evermore separates and classifies\\nthings, endeavoring to reduce the most diverse to one form. When I behold a rich\\nlandscape, it is less to my purpose to recite correctly the order and\\nsuperposition of the strata, than to know why all thought of multitude is lost\\nin a tranquil sense of unity. I cannot greatly honor minuteness in details, so\\nlong as there is no hint to explain the relation between things and thoughts; no\\nray upon the metaphysics of conchology, of botany, of the arts, to show\\nthe relation of the forms of flowers, shells, animals, architecture, to the\\nmind, and build science upon ideas. In a cabinet of natural history, we become\\nsensible of a certain occult recognition and sympathy in regard to the most\\nunwieldly and eccentric forms of beast, fish, and insect. The American who has\\nbeen confined, in his own country, to the sight of buildings designed after\\nforeign models, is surprised on entering York Minster or St. Peter's at Rome, by\\nthe feeling that these structures are imitations also,—faint copies of an\\ninvisible archetype. Nor has science sufficient humanity, so long as the\\nnaturalist overlooks that wonderful congruity which subsists between man and the\\nworld; of which he is lord, not because he is the most subtile inhabitant, but\\nbecause he is its head and heart, and finds something of himself in every great\\nand small thing, in every mountain stratum, in every new law of color, fact of\\nastronomy, or atmospheric influence which observation or analysis lay open. A\\nperception of this mystery inspires the muse of George Herbert, the beautiful\\npsalmist of the seventeenth century. The following lines are part of his little\\npoem on Man.\", '\"Man is all symmetry,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Full of proportions, one limb to another,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And to all the world\\nbesides.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Each part may call the\\nfarthest, brother;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For head with foot hath private amity,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 And both with moons and\\ntides.', '\"Nothing hath got so\\nfar\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But man hath caught and kept it as his prey;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 His eyes dismount the\\nhighest star;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 He is in little all the\\nsphere.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Herbs gladly cure our flesh, because that they\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Find their acquaintance\\nthere.', '\"For us, the winds do\\nblow,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The earth doth rest, heaven move, and fountains flow;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Nothing we see, but means\\nour good,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 As our delight, or as our\\ntreasure;\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The whole is either our cupboard of food,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Or cabinet of pleasure.', '\"The stars have us to\\nbed:\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Night draws the curtain; which the sun withdraws.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Music and light attend\\nour head.\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All things unto our flesh\\nare kind,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In their descent and being; to our mind,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In their ascent and\\ncause.', '\"More servants wait on\\nman\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Than he\\'ll take notice of.

In view of\\nthis half-sight of science, we accept the sentence of Plato, that, \"poetry comes\\nnearer to vital truth than history.\" Every surmise and vaticination of the mind\\nis entitled to a certain respect, and we learn to prefer imperfect theories, and\\nsentences, which contain glimpses of truth, to digested systems which have no\\none valuable suggestion. A wise writer will feel that the ends of study and\\ncomposition are best answered by announcing undiscovered regions of thought, and\\nso communicating, through hope, new activity to the torpid spirit.', 'I shall therefore conclude this essay with some traditions of man and nature,\\nwhich a certain poet sang to me; and which, as they have always been in the\\nworld, and perhaps reappear to every bard, may be both history and prophecy.', \"'The foundations of man are not in matter, but in spirit. But the element of\\nspirit is eternity. To it, therefore, the longest series of events, the oldest\\nchronologies are young and recent. In the cycle of the universal man, from whom\\nthe known individuals proceed, centuries are points, and all history is but the\\nepoch of one degradation.\", \"'We distrust and deny inwardly our sympathy with nature. We own and disown\\nour relation to it, by turns. We are, like Nebuchadnezzar, dethroned, bereft of\\nreason, and eating grass like an ox. But who can set limits to the remedial\\nforce of spirit?\", \"'A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and\\nshall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams. Now, the world\\nwould be insane and rabid, if these disorganizations should last for hundreds of\\nyears. It is kept in check by death and infancy. Infancy is the perpetual\\nMessiah, which comes into the arms of fallen men, and pleads with them to return\\nto paradise.\", \"'Man is the dwarf of himself. Once he was permeated and dissolved by spirit.\\nHe filled nature with his overflowing currents. Out from him sprang the sun and\\nmoon; from man, the sun; from woman, the moon. The laws of his mind, the periods\\nof his actions externized themselves into day and night, into the year and the\\nseasons. But, having made for himself this huge shell, his waters retired; he no\\nlonger fills the veins and veinlets; he is shrunk to a drop. He sees, that the\\nstructure still fits him, but fits him colossally. Say, rather, once it fitted\\nhim, now it corresponds to him from far and on high. He adores timidly his own\\nwork. Now is man the follower of the sun, and woman the follower of the moon.\\nYet sometimes he starts in his slumber, and wonders at himself and his house,\\nand muses strangely at the resemblance betwixt him and it. He perceives that if\\nhis law is still paramount, if still he have elemental power, if his word is\\nsterling yet in nature, it is not conscious power, it is not inferior but\\nsuperior to his will. It is Instinct.' Thus my Orphic poet sang.\", \"At present, man applies to nature but half his force. He works on the world\\nwith his understanding alone. He lives in it, and masters it by a penny-wisdom;\\nand he that works most in it, is but a half-man, and whilst his arms are strong\\nand his digestion good, his mind is imbruted, and he is a selfish savage. His\\nrelation to nature, his power over it, is through the understanding; as by\\nmanure; the economic use of fire, wind, water, and the mariner's needle; steam,\\ncoal, chemical agriculture; the repairs of the human body by the dentist and the\\nsurgeon. This is such a resumption of power, as if a banished king should buy\\nhis territories inch by inch, instead of vaulting at once into his throne.\\nMeantime, in the thick darkness, there are not wanting gleams of a better\\nlight,—occasional examples of the action of man upon nature with his entire\\nforce,—with reason as well as understanding. Such examples are; the traditions\\nof miracles in the earliest antiquity of all nations; the history of Jesus\\nChrist; the achievements of a principle, as in religious and political\\nrevolutions, and in the abolition of the Slave-trade; the miracles of\\nenthusiasm, as those reported of Swedenborg, Hohenlohe, and the Shakers; many\\nobscure and yet contested facts, now arranged under the name of Animal\\nMagnetism; prayer; eloquence; self-healing; and the wisdom of children. These\\nare examples of Reason's momentary grasp of the sceptre; the exertions of a\\npower which exists not in time or space, but an instantaneous in-streaming\\ncausing power. The difference between the actual and the ideal force of man is\\nhappily figured by the schoolmen, in saying, that the knowledge of man is an\\nevening knowledge,\\nvespertina cognitio, but that of God is a morning knowledge, matutina\\ncognitio.\", 'The problem of restoring to the world original and eternal beauty, is solved\\nby the redemption of the soul. The ruin or the blank, that we see when we look\\nat nature, is in our own eye. The axis of vision is not coincident with the axis\\nof things, and so they appear not transparent but opake. The reason why the\\nworld lacks unity, and lies broken and in heaps, is, because man is disunited\\nwith himself. He cannot be a naturalist, until he satisfies all the demands of\\nthe spirit. Love is as much its demand, as perception. Indeed, neither can be\\nperfect without the other. In the uttermost meaning of the words, thought is\\ndevout, and devotion is thought. Deep calls unto deep. But in actual life, the\\nmarriage is not celebrated. There are innocent men who worship God after the\\ntradition of their fathers, but their sense of duty has not yet extended to the\\nuse of all their faculties. And there are patient naturalists, but they freeze\\ntheir subject under the wintry light of the understanding. Is not prayer also a\\nstudy of truth,—a sally of the soul into the unfound infinite? No man ever\\nprayed heartily, without learning something. But when a faithful thinker,\\nresolute to detach every object from personal relations, and see it in the light\\nof thought, shall, at the same time, kindle science with the fire of the holiest\\naffections, then will God go forth anew into the creation.', 'It will not need, when the mind is prepared for study, to search for objects.\\nThe invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. What is a\\nday? What is a year? What is summer? What is woman? What is a child? What is\\nsleep? To our blindness, these things seem unaffecting. We make fables to hide\\nthe baldness of the fact and conform it, as we say, to the higher law of the\\nmind. But when the fact is seen under the light of an idea, the gaudy fable\\nfades and shrivels. We behold the real higher law. To the wise, therefore, a\\nfact is true poetry, and the most beautiful of fables. These wonders are brought\\nto our own door. You also are a man. Man and woman, and their social life,\\npoverty, labor, sleep, fear, fortune, are known to you. Learn that none of these\\nthings is superficial, but that each phenomenon has its roots in the faculties\\nand affections of the mind. Whilst the abstract question occupies your\\nintellect, nature brings it in the concrete to be solved by your hands. It were\\na wise inquiry for the closet, to compare, point by point, especially at\\nremarkable crises in life, our daily history, with the rise and progress of\\nideas in the mind.', \"So shall we come to look at the world with new eyes. It shall answer the\\nendless inquiry of the intellect,—What is truth? and of the affections,—What is\\ngood? by yielding itself passive to the educated Will. Then shall come to pass\\nwhat my poet said; 'Nature is not fixed but fluid. Spirit alters, moulds, makes\\nit. The immobility or bruteness of nature, is the absence of spirit; to pure\\nspirit, it is fluid, it is volatile, it is obedient. Every spirit builds itself\\na house; and beyond its house a world; and beyond its world, a heaven. Know\\nthen, that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect. What we\\nare, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have\\nand can do. Adam called his house, heaven and earth; Caesar called his house,\\nRome; you perhaps call yours, a cobler's trade; a hundred acres of ploughed\\nland; or a scholar's garret. Yet line for line and point for point, your\\ndominion is as great as theirs, though without fine names. Build, therefore,\\nyour own world. As fast as you conform your life to the pure idea in your mind,\\nthat will unfold its great proportions. A correspondent revolution in things\\nwill attend the influx of the spirit. So fast will disagreeable appearances,\\nswine, spiders, snakes, pests, madhouses, prisons, enemies, vanish; they are\\ntemporary and shall be no more seen. The sordor and filths of nature, the sun\\nshall dry up, and the wind exhale. As when the summer comes from the south; the\\nsnow-banks melt, and the face of the earth becomes green before it, so shall the\\nadvancing spirit create its ornaments along its path, and carry with it the\\nbeauty it visits, and the song which enchants it; it shall draw beautiful faces,\\nwarm hearts, wise discourse, and heroic acts, around its way, until evil is no\\nmore seen. The kingdom of man over nature, which cometh not with observation,—a\\ndominion such as now is beyond his dream of God,—he shall enter without more\\nwonder than the blind man feels who is gradually restored to perfect sight.'\"], ['“With fairest flowers,\\nWhilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele—”', 'When I removed into the country, it was to occupy an old-fashioned farm-house,\\nwhich had no piazza—a deficiency the more regretted, because not only did\\nI like piazzas, as somehow combining the coziness of in-doors with the freedom\\nof out-doors, and it is so pleasant to inspect your thermometer there, but the\\ncountry round about was such a picture, that in berry time no boy climbs hill\\nor crosses vale without coming upon easels planted in every nook, and sun-burnt\\npainters painting there.

An upland pasture, alleying away into a maple wood at top.\\nSweet, in opening spring, to trace upon the hill-side, otherwise gray and\\nbare—to trace, I say, the oldest paths by their streaks of earliest\\ngreen. Sweet, indeed, I can’t deny; but, to the north is Charlemagne.', 'So Charlemagne, he carried it. It was not long after 1848; and, somehow, about\\nthat time, all round the world, these kings, they had the casting vote, and\\nvoted for themselves.', 'No sooner was ground broken, than all the neighborhood, neighbor Dives, in\\nparticular, broke, too—into a laugh. Piazza to the north! Winter piazza!\\nWants, of winter midnights, to watch the Aurora Borealis, I suppose; hope\\nhe’s laid in good store of Polar muffs and mittens.', 'That was in the lion month of March. Not forgotten are the blue noses of the\\ncarpenters, and how they scouted at the greenness of the cit, who would build\\nhis sole piazza to the north. But March don’t last forever; patience, and\\nAugust comes. And then, in the cool elysium of my northern bower, I, Lazarus in\\nAbraham’s bosom, cast down the hill a pitying glance on poor old Dives,\\ntormented in the purgatory of his piazza to the south.', 'But, even in December, this northern piazza does not repel—nipping cold\\nand gusty though it be, and the north wind, like any miller, bolting by the\\nsnow, in finest flour—for then, once more, with frosted beard, I pace the\\nsleety deck, weathering Cape Horn.', 'In summer, too, Canute-like, sitting here, one is often reminded of the sea.\\nFor not only do long ground-swells roll the slanting grain, and little wavelets\\nof the grass ripple over upon the low piazza, as their beach, and the blown\\ndown of dandelions is wafted like the spray, and the purple of the mountains is\\njust the purple of the billows, and a still August noon broods upon the deep\\nmeadows, as a calm upon the Line; but the vastness and the lonesomeness are so\\noceanic, and the silence and the sameness, too, that the first peep of a\\nstrange house, rising beyond the trees, is for all the world like spying, on\\nthe Barbary coast, an unknown sail.', 'And this recalls my inland voyage to fairy-land. A true voyage; but, take it\\nall in all, interesting as if invented.', 'From the piazza, some uncertain object I had caught, mysteriously snugged away,\\nto all appearance, in a sort of purpled breast-pocket, high up in a hopper-like\\nhollow, or sunken angle, among the northwestern mountains—yet, whether,\\nreally, it was on a mountain-side, or a mountain-top, could not be determined;\\nbecause, though, viewed from favorable points, a blue summit, peering up away\\nbehind the rest, will, as it were, talk to you over their heads, and plainly\\ntell you, that, though he (the blue summit) seems among them, he is not of them\\n(God forbid!), and, indeed, would have you know that he considers\\nhimself—as, to say truth, he has good right—by several cubits their\\nsuperior, nevertheless, certain ranges, here and there double-filed, as in\\nplatoons, so shoulder and follow up upon one another, with their irregular\\nshapes and heights, that, from the piazza, a nigher and lower mountain will, in\\nmost states of the atmosphere, effacingly shade itself away into a higher and\\nfurther one; that an object, bleak on the former’s crest, will, for all\\nthat, appear nested in the latter’s flank. These mountains, somehow, they\\nplay at hide-and-seek, and all before one’s eyes.', 'But, be that as it may, the spot in question was, at all events, so situated as\\nto be only visible, and then but vaguely, under certain witching conditions of\\nlight and shadow.', 'Indeed, for a year or more, I knew not there was such a spot, and might,\\nperhaps, have never known, had it not been for a wizard afternoon in\\nautumn—late in autumn—a mad poet’s afternoon; when the turned\\nmaple woods in the broad basin below me, having lost their first vermilion\\ntint, dully smoked, like smouldering towns, when flames expire upon their prey;\\nand rumor had it, that this smokiness in the general air was not all Indian\\nsummer—which was not used to be so sick a thing, however mild—but,\\nin great part, was blown from far-off forests, for weeks on fire, in Vermont;\\nso that no wonder the sky was ominous as Hecate’s cauldron—and two\\nsportsmen, crossing a red stubble buck-wheat field, seemed guilty Macbeth and\\nforeboding Banquo; and the hermit-sun, hutted in an Adullum cave, well towards\\nthe south, according to his season, did little else but, by indirect reflection\\nof narrow rays shot down a Simplon pass among the clouds, just steadily paint\\none small, round, strawberry mole upon the wan cheek of northwestern hills.\\nSignal as a candle. One spot of radiance, where all else was shade.', 'Fairies there, thought I; some haunted ring where fairies dance.', 'Time passed; and the following May, after a gentle shower upon the\\nmountains—a little shower islanded in misty seas of sunshine; such a\\ndistant shower—and sometimes two, and three, and four of them, all\\nvisible together in different parts—as I love to watch from the piazza,\\ninstead of thunder storms, as I used to, which wrap old Greylock, like a Sinai,\\ntill one thinks swart Moses must be climbing among scathed hemlocks there;\\nafter, I say, that, gentle shower, I saw a rainbow, resting its further end\\njust where, in autumn, I had marked the mole. Fairies there, thought I;\\nremembering that rainbows bring out the blooms, and that, if one can but get to\\nthe rainbow’s end, his fortune is made in a bag of gold. Yon\\nrainbow’s end, would I were there, thought I. And none the less I wished\\nit, for now first noticing what seemed some sort of glen, or grotto, in the\\nmountain side; at least, whatever it was, viewed through the rainbow’s\\nmedium, it glowed like the Potosi mine. But a work-a-day neighbor said, no\\ndoubt it was but some old barn—an abandoned one, its broadside beaten in,\\nthe acclivity its background. But I, though I had never been there, I knew\\nbetter.', 'A few days after, a cheery sunrise kindled a golden sparkle in the same spot as\\nbefore. The sparkle was of that vividness, it seemed as if it could only come\\nfrom glass. The building, then—if building, after all, it\\nwas—could, at least, not be a barn, much less an abandoned one; stale hay\\nten years musting in it. No; if aught built by mortal, it must be a cottage;\\nperhaps long vacant and dismantled, but this very spring magically fitted up\\nand glazed.', 'Again, one noon, in the same direction, I marked, over dimmed tops of terraced\\nfoliage, a broader gleam, as of a silver buckler, held sunwards over some\\ncroucher’s head; which gleam, experience in like cases taught, must come\\nfrom a roof newly shingled. This, to me, made pretty sure the recent occupancy\\nof that far cot in fairy land.', 'Day after day, now, full of interest in my discovery, what time I could spare\\nfrom reading the Midsummer’s Night Dream, and all about Titania,\\nwishfully I gazed off towards the hills; but in vain. Either troops of shadows,\\nan imperial guard, with slow pace and solemn, defiled along the steeps; or,\\nrouted by pursuing light, fled broadcast from east to west—old wars of\\nLucifer and Michael; or the mountains, though unvexed by these mirrored sham\\nfights in the sky, had an atmosphere otherwise unfavorable for fairy views. I\\nwas sorry; the more so, because I had to keep my chamber for some time\\nafter—which chamber did not face those hills.', 'At length, when pretty well again, and sitting out, in the September morning,\\nupon the piazza, and thinking to myself, when, just after a little flock of\\nsheep, the farmer’s banded children passed, a-nutting, and said,\\n“How sweet a day”—it was, after all, but what their fathers\\ncall a weather-breeder—and, indeed, was become so sensitive through my\\nillness, as that I could not bear to look upon a Chinese creeper of my\\nadoption, and which, to my delight, climbing a post of the piazza, had burst\\nout in starry bloom, but now, if you removed the leaves a little, showed\\nmillions of strange, cankerous worms, which, feeding upon those blossoms, so\\nshared their blessed hue, as to make it unblessed evermore—worms, whose\\ngerms had doubtless lurked in the very bulb which, so hopefully, I had planted:\\nin this ingrate peevishness of my weary convalescence, was I sitting there;\\nwhen, suddenly looking off, I saw the golden mountain-window, dazzling like a\\ndeep-sea dolphin. Fairies there, thought I, once more; the queen of fairies at\\nher fairy-window; at any rate, some glad mountain-girl; it will do me good, it\\nwill cure this weariness, to look on her. No more; I’ll launch my\\nyawl—ho, cheerly, heart! and push away for fairy-land—for\\nrainbow’s end, in fairy-land.', 'How to get to fairy-land, by what road, I did not know; nor could any one\\ninform me; not even one Edmund Spenser, who had been there—so he wrote\\nme—further than that to reach fairy-land, it must be voyaged to, and with\\nfaith. I took the fairy-mountain’s bearings, and the first fine day, when\\nstrength permitted, got into my yawl—high-pommeled, leather\\none—cast off the fast, and away I sailed, free voyager as an autumn leaf.\\nEarly dawn; and, sallying westward, I sowed the morning before me.', 'Some miles brought me nigh the hills; but out of present sight of them. I was\\nnot lost; for road-side golden-rods, as guide-posts, pointed, I doubted not,\\nthe way to the golden window. Following them, I came to a lone and languid\\nregion, where the grass-grown ways were traveled but by drowsy cattle, that,\\nless waked than stirred by day, seemed to walk in sleep. Browse, they did\\nnot—the enchanted never eat. At least, so says Don Quixote, that sagest\\nsage that ever lived.', 'On I went, and gained at last the fairy mountain’s base, but saw yet no\\nfairy ring. A pasture rose before me. Letting down five mouldering\\nbars—so moistly green, they seemed fished up from some sunken\\nwreck—a wigged old Aries, long-visaged, and with crumpled horn, came\\nsnuffing up; and then, retreating, decorously led on along a milky-way of\\nwhite-weed, past dim-clustering Pleiades and Hyades, of small forget-me-nots;\\nand would have led me further still his astral path, but for golden flights of\\nyellow-birds—pilots, surely, to the golden window, to one side flying\\nbefore me, from bush to bush, towards deep woods—which woods themselves\\nwere luring—and, somehow, lured, too, by their fence, banning a dark\\nroad, which, however dark, led up. I pushed through; when Aries, renouncing me\\nnow for some lost soul, wheeled, and went his wiser way. Forbidding and\\nforbidden ground—to him.', 'A winter wood road, matted all along with winter-green. By the side of pebbly\\nwaters—waters the cheerier for their solitude; beneath swaying\\nfir-boughs, petted by no season, but still green in all, on I\\njourneyed—my horse and I; on, by an old saw-mill, bound down and hushed\\nwith vines, that his grating voice no more was heard; on, by a deep flume clove\\nthrough snowy marble, vernal-tinted, where freshet eddies had, on each side,\\nspun out empty chapels in the living rock; on, where Jacks-in-the-pulpit, like\\ntheir Baptist namesake, preached but to the wilderness; on, where a huge,\\ncross-grain block, fern-bedded, showed where, in forgotten times, man after man\\nhad tried to split it, but lost his wedges for his pains—which wedges yet\\nrusted in their holes; on, where, ages past, in step-like ledges of a cascade,\\nskull-hollow pots had been churned out by ceaseless whirling of a\\nflintstone—ever wearing, but itself unworn; on, by wild rapids pouring\\ninto a secret pool, but soothed by circling there awhile, issued forth\\nserenely; on, to less broken ground, and by a little ring, where, truly,\\nfairies must have danced, or else some wheel-tire been heated—for all was\\nbare; still on, and up, and out into a hanging orchard, where maidenly looked\\ndown upon me a crescent moon, from morning.', 'My horse hitched low his head. Red apples rolled before him; Eve’s\\napples; seek-no-furthers. He tasted one, I another; it tasted of the ground.\\nFairy land not yet, thought I, flinging my bridle to a humped old tree, that\\ncrooked out an arm to catch it. For the way now lay where path was none, and\\nnone might go but by himself, and only go by daring. Through blackberry brakes\\nthat tried to pluck me back, though I but strained towards fruitless growths of\\nmountain-laurel; up slippery steeps to barren heights, where stood none to\\nwelcome. Fairy land not yet, thought I, though the morning is here before me.', 'Foot-sore enough and weary, I gained not then my journey’s end, but came\\nere long to a craggy pass, dipping towards growing regions still beyond. A\\nzigzag road, half overgrown with blueberry bushes, here turned among the\\ncliffs. A rent was in their ragged sides; through it a little track branched\\noff, which, upwards threading that short defile, came breezily out above, to\\nwhere the mountain-top, part sheltered northward, by a taller brother, sloped\\ngently off a space, ere darkly plunging; and here, among fantastic rocks,\\nreposing in a herd, the foot-track wound, half beaten, up to a little,\\nlow-storied, grayish cottage, capped, nun-like, with a peaked roof.', 'On one slope, the roof was deeply weather-stained, and, nigh the turfy\\neaves-trough, all velvet-napped; no doubt the snail-monks founded mossy\\npriories there. The other slope was newly shingled. On the north side, doorless\\nand windowless, the clap-boards, innocent of paint, were yet green as the north\\nside of lichened pines or copperless hulls of Japanese junks, becalmed. The\\nwhole base, like those of the neighboring rocks, was rimmed about with shaded\\nstreaks of richest sod; for, with hearth-stones in fairy land, the natural\\nrock, though housed, preserves to the last, just as in open fields, its\\nfertilizing charm; only, by necessity, working now at a remove, to the sward\\nwithout. So, at least, says Oberon, grave authority in fairy lore. Though\\nsetting Oberon aside, certain it is, that, even in the common world, the soil,\\nclose up to farm-houses, as close up to pasture rocks, is, even though\\nuntended, ever richer than it is a few rods off—such gentle, nurturing\\nheat is radiated there.', 'But with this cottage, the shaded streaks were richest in its front and about\\nits entrance, where the ground-sill, and especially the doorsill had, through\\nlong eld, quietly settled down.', 'No fence was seen, no inclosure. Near by—ferns, ferns, ferns;\\nfurther—woods, woods, woods; beyond—mountains, mountains,\\nmountains; then—sky, sky, sky. Turned out in aerial commons, pasture for\\nthe mountain moon. Nature, and but nature, house and, all; even a low\\ncross-pile of silver birch, piled openly, to season; up among whose silvery\\nsticks, as through the fencing of some sequestered grave, sprang vagrant\\nraspberry bushes—willful assertors of their right of way.', 'The foot-track, so dainty narrow, just like a sheep-track, led through long\\nferns that lodged. Fairy land at last, thought I; Una and her lamb dwell here.\\nTruly, a small abode—mere palanquin, set down on the summit, in a pass\\nbetween two worlds, participant of neither.', 'A sultry hour, and I wore a light hat, of yellow sinnet, with white duck\\ntrowsers—both relics of my tropic sea-going. Clogged in the muffling\\nferns, I softly stumbled, staining the knees a sea-green.', 'Pausing at the threshold, or rather where threshold once had been, I saw,\\nthrough the open door-way, a lonely girl, sewing at a lonely window. A\\npale-cheeked girl, and fly-specked window, with wasps about the mended upper\\npanes. I spoke. She shyly started, like some Tahiti girl, secreted for a\\nsacrifice, first catching sight, through palms, of Captain Cook. Recovering,\\nshe bade me enter; with her apron brushed off a stool; then silently resumed\\nher own. With thanks I took the stool; but now, for a space, I, too, was mute.\\nThis, then, is the fairy-mountain house, and here, the fairy queen sitting at\\nher fairy window.', 'I went up to it. Downwards, directed by the tunneled pass, as through a leveled\\ntelescope, I caught sight of a far-off, soft, azure world. I hardly knew it,\\nthough I came from it.', '“You must find this view very pleasant,” said I, at last.', '“Oh, sir,” tears starting in her eyes, “the first time I\\nlooked out of this window, I said ‘never, never shall I weary of\\nthis.’”', '“And what wearies you of it now?”', '“I don’t know,” while a tear fell; “but it is not the\\nview, it is Marianna.”', 'Some months back, her brother, only seventeen, had come hither, a long way from\\nthe other side, to cut wood and burn coal, and she, elder sister, had\\naccompanied, him. Long had they been orphans, and now, sole inhabitants of the\\nsole house upon the mountain. No guest came, no traveler passed. The zigzag,\\nperilous road was only used at seasons by the coal wagons. The brother was\\nabsent the entire day, sometimes the entire night. When at evening, fagged out,\\nhe did come home, he soon left his bench, poor fellow, for his bed; just as\\none, at last, wearily quits that, too, for still deeper rest. The bench, the\\nbed, the grave.', 'Silent I stood by the fairy window, while these things were being told.', '“Do you know,” said she at last, as stealing from her story,\\n“do you know who lives yonder?—I have never been down into that\\ncountry—away off there, I mean; that house, that marble one,”\\npointing far across the lower landscape; “have you not caught it? there,\\non the long hill-side: the field before, the woods behind; the white shines out\\nagainst their blue; don’t you mark it? the only house in sight.”', 'I looked; and after a time, to my surprise, recognized, more by its position\\nthan its aspect, or Marianna’s description, my own abode, glimmering much\\nlike this mountain one from the piazza. The mirage haze made it appear less a\\nfarm-house than King Charming’s palace.', '“I have often wondered who lives there; but it must be some happy one;\\nagain this morning was I thinking so.”', '“Some happy one,” returned I, starting; “and why do you think\\nthat? You judge some rich one lives there?”', '“Rich or not, I never thought; but it looks so happy, I can’t tell\\nhow; and it is so far away. Sometimes I think I do but dream it is there. You\\nshould see it in a sunset.”', '“No doubt the sunset gilds it finely; but not more than the sunrise does\\nthis house, perhaps.”', '“This house? The sun is a good sun, but it never gilds this house. Why\\nshould it? This old house is rotting. That makes it so mossy. In the morning,\\nthe sun comes in at this old window, to be sure—boarded up, when first we\\ncame; a window I can’t keep clean, do what I may—and half burns,\\nand nearly blinds me at my sewing, besides setting the flies and wasps\\nastir—such flies and wasps as only lone mountain houses know. See, here\\nis the curtain—this apron—I try to shut it out with then. It fades\\nit, you see. Sun gild this house? not that ever Marianna saw.”', '“Because when this roof is gilded most, then you stay here within.”', '“The hottest, weariest hour of day, you mean? Sir, the sun gilds not this\\nroof. It leaked so, brother newly shingled all one side. Did you not see it?\\nThe north side, where the sun strikes most on what the rain has wetted. The sun\\nis a good sun; but this roof, in first scorches, and then rots. An old house.\\nThey went West, and are long dead, they say, who built it. A mountain house. In\\nwinter no fox could den in it. That chimney-place has been blocked up with\\nsnow, just like a hollow stump.”', '“Yours are strange fancies, Marianna.”', '“They but reflect the things.”', '“Then I should have said, ‘These are strange things,’ rather\\nthan, ‘Yours are strange fancies.’”', '“As you will;” and took up her sewing.', 'Something in those quiet words, or in that quiet act, it made me mute again;\\nwhile, noting, through the fairy window, a broad shadow stealing on, as cast by\\nsome gigantic condor, floating at brooding poise on outstretched wings, I\\nmarked how, by its deeper and inclusive dusk, it wiped away into itself all\\nlesser shades of rock or fern.', '“You watch the cloud,” said Marianna.', '“No, a shadow; a cloud’s, no doubt—though that I cannot see.\\nHow did you know it? Your eyes are on your work.”', '“It dusked my work. There, now the cloud is gone, Tray comes back.”', '“How?”', '“The dog, the shaggy dog. At noon, he steals off, of himself, to change\\nhis shape—returns, and lies down awhile, nigh the door. Don’t you\\nsee him? His head is turned round at you; though, when you came, he looked\\nbefore him.”', '“Your eyes rest but on your work; what do you speak of?”', '“By the window, crossing.”', '“You mean this shaggy shadow—the nigh one? And, yes, now that I\\nmark it, it is not unlike a large, black Newfoundland dog. The invading shadow\\ngone, the invaded one returns. But I do not see what casts it.”', '“For that, you must go without.”', '“One of those grassy rocks, no doubt.”', '“You see his head, his face?”', '“The shadow’s? You speak as if you saw it, and all the time\\nyour eyes are on your work.”', '“Tray looks at you,” still without glancing up; “this is his\\nhour; I see him.”', '“Have you then, so long sat at this mountain-window, where but clouds\\nand, vapors pass, that, to you, shadows are as things, though you speak of them\\nas of phantoms; that, by familiar knowledge, working like a second sight, you\\ncan, without looking for them, tell just where they are, though, as having\\nmice-like feet, they creep about, and come and go; that, to you, these lifeless\\nshadows are as living friends, who, though out of sight, are not out of mind,\\neven in their faces—is it so?”', '“That way I never thought of it. But the friendliest one, that used to\\nsoothe my weariness so much, coolly quivering on the ferns, it was taken from\\nme, never to return, as Tray did just now. The shadow of a birch. The tree was\\nstruck by lightning, and brother cut it up. You saw the cross-pile\\nout-doors—the buried root lies under it; but not the shadow. That is\\nflown, and never will come back, nor ever anywhere stir again.”', 'Another cloud here stole along, once more blotting out the dog, and blackening\\nall the mountain; while the stillness was so still, deafness might have forgot\\nitself, or else believed that noiseless shadow spoke.', '“Birds, Marianna, singing-birds, I hear none; I hear nothing. Boys and\\nbob-o-links, do they never come a-berrying up here?”', '“Birds, I seldom hear; boys, never. The berries mostly ripe and\\nfall—few, but me, the wiser.”', '“But yellow-birds showed me the way—part way, at least.”', '“And then flew back. I guess they play about the mountain-side, but\\ndon’t make the top their home. And no doubt you think that, living so\\nlonesome here, knowing nothing, hearing nothing—little, at least, but\\nsound of thunder and the fall of trees—never reading, seldom speaking,\\nyet ever wakeful, this is what gives me my strange thoughts—for so you\\ncall them—this weariness and wakefulness together Brother, who stands and\\nworks in open air, would I could rest like him; but mine is mostly but dull\\nwoman’s work—sitting, sitting, restless sitting.”', '“But, do you not go walk at times? These woods are wide.”', '“And lonesome; lonesome, because so wide. Sometimes, ’tis true, of\\nafternoons, I go a little way; but soon come back again. Better feel lone by\\nhearth, than rock. The shadows hereabouts I know—those in the woods are\\nstrangers.”', '“But the night?”', '“Just like the day. Thinking, thinking—a wheel I cannot stop; pure\\nwant of sleep it is that turns it.”', '“I have heard that, for this wakeful weariness, to say one’s\\nprayers, and then lay one’s head upon a fresh hop pillow—”', '“Look!”', 'Through the fairy window, she pointed down the steep to a small garden patch\\nnear by—mere pot of rifled loam, half rounded in by sheltering\\nrocks—where, side by side, some feet apart, nipped and puny, two\\nhop-vines climbed two poles, and, gaining their tip-ends, would have then\\njoined over in an upward clasp, but the baffled shoots, groping awhile in empty\\nair, trailed back whence they sprung.', '“You have tried the pillow, then?”', '“Yes.”', '“And prayer?”', '“Prayer and pillow.”', '“Is there no other cure, or charm?”', '“Oh, if I could but once get to yonder house, and but look upon whoever\\nthe happy being is that lives there! A foolish thought: why do I think it? Is\\nit that I live so lonesome, and know nothing?”', '“I, too, know nothing; and, therefore, cannot answer; but, for your sake,\\nMarianna, well could wish that I were that happy one of the happy house you\\ndream you see; for then you would behold him now, and, as you say, this\\nweariness might leave you.”', '—Enough. Launching my yawl no more for fairy-land, I stick to the piazza.\\nIt is my box-royal; and this amphitheatre, my theatre of San Carlo. Yes, the\\nscenery is magical—the illusion so complete. And Madam Meadow Lark, my\\nprima donna, plays her grand engagement here; and, drinking in her sunrise\\nnote, which, Memnon-like, seems struck from the golden window, how far from me\\nthe weary face behind it.', 'But, every night, when the curtain falls, truth comes in with darkness. No\\nlight shows from the mountain. To and fro I walk the piazza deck, haunted by\\nMarianna’s face, and many as real a story.', 'I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations, for the last thirty\\nyears, has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an\\ninteresting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom, as yet, nothing, that I\\nknow of, has ever been written—I mean, the law-copyists, or scriveners. I\\nhave known very many of them, professionally and privately, and, if I pleased,\\ncould relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and\\nsentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other\\nscriveners, for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener,\\nthe strangest I ever saw, or heard of. While, of other law-copyists, I might\\nwrite the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done. I\\nbelieve that no materials exist, for a full and satisfactory biography of this\\nman. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one of those beings\\nof whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the original sources, and, in his\\ncase, those are very small. What my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby,\\nthat is all I know of him, except, indeed, one vague report, which will\\nappear in the sequel.', 'Ere introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I make\\nsome mention of myself, my employés, my business, my chambers, and\\ngeneral surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to an\\nadequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented. Imprimis:\\nI am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with a profound\\nconviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence, though I belong to\\na profession proverbially energetic and nervous, even to turbulence, at times,\\nyet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace. I am one of\\nthose unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury, or in any way draws down\\npublic applause; but, in the cool tranquillity of a snug retreat, do a snug\\nbusiness among rich men’s bonds, and mortgages, and title-deeds. All who\\nknow me, consider me an eminently safe man. The late John Jacob Astor, a\\npersonage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in pronouncing\\nmy first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do not speak it in\\nvanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not unemployed in my profession\\nby the late John Jacob Astor; a name which, I admit, I love to repeat; for it\\nhath a rounded and orbicular sound to it, and rings like unto bullion. I will\\nfreely add, that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor’s good\\nopinion.', 'Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my\\navocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct in the\\nState of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred upon me. It was\\nnot a very arduous office, but very pleasantly remunerative. I seldom lose my\\ntemper; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and\\noutrages; but, I must be permitted to be rash here, and declare, that I\\nconsider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master in Chancery,\\nby the new Constitution, as a —— premature act; inasmuch as I had\\ncounted upon a life-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a\\nfew short years. But this is by the way.', 'My chambers were up stairs, at No. —— Wall street. At one end, they\\nlooked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious skylight shaft,\\npenetrating the building from top to bottom.', 'This view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise, deficient in\\nwhat landscape painters call “life.” But, if so, the view from the\\nother end of my chambers offered, at least, a contrast, if nothing more. In\\nthat direction, my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick\\nwall, black by age and everlasting shade; which wall required no spy-glass to\\nbring out its lurking beauties, but, for the benefit of all near-sighted\\nspectators, was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes. Owing to the\\ngreat height of the surrounding buildings, and my chambers being on the second\\nfloor, the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge\\nsquare cistern.', 'At the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby, I had two persons as\\ncopyists in my employment, and a promising lad as an office-boy. First, Turkey;\\nsecond, Nippers; third, Ginger Nut. These may seem names, the like of which are\\nnot usually found in the Directory. In truth, they were nicknames, mutually\\nconferred upon each other by my three clerks, and were deemed expressive of\\ntheir respective persons or characters. Turkey was a short, pursy Englishman,\\nof about my own age—that is, somewhere not far from sixty. In the\\nmorning, one might say, his face was of a fine florid hue, but after twelve\\no’clock, meridian—his dinner hour—it blazed like a grate full\\nof Christmas coals; and continued blazing—but, as it were, with a gradual\\nwane—till six o’clock, P.M., or thereabouts; after which, I saw no\\nmore of the proprietor of the face, which, gaining its meridian with the sun,\\nseemed to set with it, to rise, culminate, and decline the following day, with\\nthe like regularity and undiminished glory. There are many singular\\ncoincidences I have known in the course of my life, not the least among which\\nwas the fact, that, exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his\\nred and radiant countenance, just then, too, at that critical moment, began the\\ndaily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed\\nfor the remainder of the twenty-four hours. Not that he was absolutely idle, or\\naverse to business, then; far from it. The difficulty was, he was apt to be\\naltogether too energetic. There was a strange, inflamed, flurried, flighty\\nrecklessness of activity about him. He would be incautious in dipping his pen\\ninto his inkstand. All his blots upon my documents were dropped there after\\ntwelve o’clock, meridian. Indeed, not only would he be reckless, and\\nsadly given to making blots in the afternoon, but, some days, he went further,\\nand was rather noisy. At such times, too, his face flamed with augmented\\nblazonry, as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite. He made an\\nunpleasant racket with his chair; spilled his sand-box; in mending his pens,\\nimpatiently split them all to pieces, and threw them on the floor in a sudden\\npassion; stood up, and leaned over his table, boxing his papers about in a most\\nindecorous manner, very sad to behold in an elderly man like him. Nevertheless,\\nas he was in many ways a most valuable person to me, and all the time before\\ntwelve o’clock, meridian, was the quickest, steadiest creature, too,\\naccomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easily to be\\nmatched—for these reasons, I was willing to overlook his eccentricities,\\nthough, indeed, occasionally, I remonstrated with him. I did this very gently,\\nhowever, because, though the civilest, nay, the blandest and most reverential\\nof men in the morning, yet, in the afternoon, he was disposed, upon\\nprovocation, to be slightly rash with his tongue—in fact, insolent. Now,\\nvaluing his morning services as I did, and resolved not to lose them—yet,\\nat the same time, made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve\\no’clock—and being a man of peace, unwilling by my admonitions to\\ncall forth unseemly retorts from him, I took upon me, one Saturday noon (he was\\nalways worse on Saturdays) to hint to him, very kindly, that, perhaps, now that\\nhe was growing old, it might be well to abridge his labors; in short, he need\\nnot come to my chambers after twelve o’clock, but, dinner over, had best\\ngo home to his lodgings, and rest himself till tea-time. But no; he insisted\\nupon his afternoon devotions. His countenance became intolerably fervid, as he\\noratorically assured me—gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end\\nof the room—that if his services in the morning were useful, how\\nindispensable, then, in the afternoon?', '“With submission, sir,” said Turkey, on this occasion, “I\\nconsider myself your right-hand man. In the morning I but marshal and deploy my\\ncolumns; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head, and gallantly charge\\nthe foe, thus”—and he made a violent thrust with the ruler.', '“But the blots, Turkey,” intimated I.', '“True; but, with submission, sir, behold these hairs! I am getting old.\\nSurely, sir, a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged\\nagainst gray hairs. Old age—even if it blot the page—is honorable.\\nWith submission, sir, we both are getting old.”', 'This appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted. At all events, I\\nsaw that go he would not. So, I made up my mind to let him stay, resolving,\\nnevertheless, to see to it that, during the afternoon, he had to do with my\\nless important papers.', 'Nippers, the second on my list, was a whiskered, sallow, and, upon the whole,\\nrather piratical-looking young man, of about five and twenty. I always deemed\\nhim the victim of two evil powers—ambition and indigestion. The ambition\\nwas evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist, an\\nunwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs, such as the original\\ndrawing up of legal documents. The indigestion seemed betokened in an\\noccasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability, causing the teeth to\\naudibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying; unnecessary\\nmaledictions, hissed, rather than spoken, in the heat of business; and\\nespecially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he\\nworked. Though of a very ingenious mechanical turn, Nippers could never get\\nthis table to suit him. He put chips under it, blocks of various sorts, bits of\\npasteboard, and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment, by\\nfinal pieces of folded blotting-paper. But no invention would answer. If, for\\nthe sake of easing his back, he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up\\ntowards his chin, and wrote, there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch\\nhouse for his desk, then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his\\narms. If now he lowered the table to his waistbands, and stooped over it in\\nwriting, then there was a sore aching in his back. In short, the truth of the\\nmatter was, Nippers knew not what he wanted. Or, if he wanted anything, it was\\nto be rid of a scrivener’s table altogether. Among the manifestations of\\nhis diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain\\nambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats, whom he called his clients. Indeed, I\\nwas aware that not only was he, at times, considerable of a ward-politician,\\nbut he occasionally did a little business at the Justices’ courts, and\\nwas not unknown on the steps of the Tombs. I have good reason to believe,\\nhowever, that one individual who called upon him at my chambers, and who, with\\na grand air, he insisted was his client, was no other than a dun, and the\\nalleged title-deed, a bill. But, with all his failings, and the annoyances he\\ncaused me, Nippers, like his compatriot Turkey, was a very useful man to me;\\nwrote a neat, swift hand; and, when he chose, was not deficient in a\\ngentlemanly sort of deportment. Added to this, he always dressed in a\\ngentlemanly sort of way; and so, incidentally, reflected credit upon my\\nchambers. Whereas, with respect to Turkey, I had much ado to keep him from\\nbeing a reproach to me. His clothes were apt to look oily, and smell of\\neating-houses. He wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer. His coats\\nwere execrable; his hat not to be handled. But while the hat was a thing of\\nindifference to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, as a\\ndependent Englishman, always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room,\\nyet his coat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but\\nwith no effect. The truth was, I suppose, that a man with so small an income\\ncould not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and\\nthe same time. As Nippers once observed, Turkey’s money went chiefly for\\nred ink. One winter day, I presented Turkey with a highly respectable-looking\\ncoat of my own—a padded gray coat, of a most comfortable warmth, and\\nwhich buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I thought Turkey would\\nappreciate the favor, and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of\\nafternoons. But no; I verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and\\nblanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him—upon the same\\nprinciple that too much oats are bad for horses. In fact, precisely as a rash,\\nrestive horse is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his coat. It made him\\ninsolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed.', 'Though, concerning the self-indulgent habits of Turkey, I had my own private\\nsurmises, yet, touching Nippers, I was well persuaded that, whatever might be\\nhis faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate young man. But,\\nindeed, nature herself seemed to have been his vintner, and, at his birth,\\ncharged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that all\\nsubsequent potations were needless. When I consider how, amid the stillness of\\nmy chambers, Nippers would sometimes impatiently rise from his seat, and\\nstooping over his table, spread his arms wide apart, seize the whole desk, and\\nmove it, and jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the\\ntable were a perverse voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him, I\\nplainly perceive that, for Nippers, brandy-and-water were altogether\\nsuperfluous.', 'It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar\\ncause—indigestion—the irritability and consequent nervousness of\\nNippers were mainly observable in the morning, while in the afternoon he was\\ncomparatively mild. So that, Turkey’s paroxysms only coming on about\\ntwelve o’clock, I never had to do with their eccentricities at one time.\\nTheir fits relieved each other, like guards. When Nippers’s was on,\\nTurkey’s was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural\\narrangement, under the circumstances.', 'Ginger Nut, the third on my list, was a lad, some twelve years old. His, father\\nwas a carman, ambitious of seeing his son on the bench instead of a cart,\\nbefore he died. So he sent him to my office, as student at law, errand-boy,\\ncleaner and sweeper, at the rate of one dollar a week. He had a little desk to\\nhimself, but he did not use it much. Upon inspection, the drawer exhibited a\\ngreat array of the shells of various sorts of nuts. Indeed, to this\\nquick-witted youth, the whole noble science of the law was contained in a\\nnut-shell. Not the least among the employments of Ginger Nut, as well as one\\nwhich he discharged with the most alacrity, was his duty as cake and apple\\npurveyor for Turkey and Nippers. Copying law-papers being proverbially a dry,\\nhusky sort of business, my two scriveners were fain to moisten their mouths\\nvery often with Spitzenbergs, to be had at the numerous stalls nigh the Custom\\nHouse and Post Office. Also, they sent Ginger Nut very frequently for that\\npeculiar cake—small, flat, round, and very spicy—after which he had\\nbeen named by them. Of a cold morning, when business was but dull, Turkey would\\ngobble up scores of these cakes, as if they were mere wafers—indeed, they\\nsell them at the rate of six or eight for a penny—the scrape of his pen\\nblending with the crunching of the crisp particles in his mouth. Of all the\\nfiery afternoon blunders and flurried rashnesses of Turkey, was his once\\nmoistening a ginger-cake between his lips, and clapping it on to a mortgage,\\nfor a seal. I came within an ace of dismissing him then. But he mollified me by\\nmaking an oriental bow, and saying—', '“With submission, sir, it was generous of me to find you in stationery on\\nmy own account.”', 'Now my original business—that of a conveyancer and title hunter, and\\ndrawer-up of recondite documents of all sorts—was considerably increased\\nby receiving the master’s office. There was now great work for\\nscriveners. Not only must I push the clerks already with me, but I must have\\nadditional help.', 'In answer to my advertisement, a motionless young man one morning stood upon my\\noffice threshold, the door being open, for it was summer. I can see that figure\\nnow—pallidly neat, pitiably respectable, incurably forlorn! It was\\nBartleby.', 'After a few words touching his qualifications, I engaged him, glad to have\\namong my corps of copyists a man of so singularly sedate an aspect, which I\\nthought might operate beneficially upon the flighty temper of Turkey, and the\\nfiery one of Nippers.', 'I should have stated before that ground glass folding-doors divided my premises\\ninto two parts, one of which was occupied by my scriveners, the other by\\nmyself. According to my humor, I threw open these doors, or closed them. I\\nresolved to assign Bartleby a corner by the folding-doors, but on my side of\\nthem, so as to have this quiet man within easy call, in case any trifling thing\\nwas to be done. I placed his desk close up to a small side-window in that part\\nof the room, a window which originally had afforded a lateral view of certain\\ngrimy backyards and bricks, but which, owing to subsequent erections, commanded\\nat present no view at all, though it gave some light. Within three feet of the\\npanes was a wall, and the light came down from far above, between two lofty\\nbuildings, as from a very small opening in a dome. Still further to a\\nsatisfactory arrangement, I procured a high green folding screen, which might\\nentirely isolate Bartleby from my sight, though not remove him from my voice.\\nAnd thus, in a manner, privacy and society were conjoined.', 'At first, Bartleby did an extraordinary quantity of writing. As if long\\nfamishing for something to copy, he seemed to gorge himself on my documents.\\nThere was no pause for digestion. He ran a day and night line, copying by\\nsun-light and by candle-light. I should have been quite delighted with his\\napplication, had he been cheerfully industrious. But he wrote on silently,\\npalely, mechanically.', 'It is, of course, an indispensable part of a scrivener’s business to\\nverify the accuracy of his copy, word by word. Where there are two or more\\nscriveners in an office, they assist each other in this examination, one\\nreading from the copy, the other holding the original. It is a very dull,\\nwearisome, and lethargic affair. I can readily imagine that, to some sanguine\\ntemperaments, it would be altogether intolerable. For example, I cannot credit\\nthat the mettlesome poet, Byron, would have contentedly sat down with Bartleby\\nto examine a law document of, say five hundred pages, closely written in a\\ncrimpy hand.', 'Now and then, in the haste of business, it had been my habit to assist in\\ncomparing some brief document myself, calling Turkey or Nippers for this\\npurpose. One object I had, in placing Bartleby so handy to me behind the\\nscreen, was, to avail myself of his services on such trivial occasions. It was\\non the third day, I think, of his being with me, and before any necessity had\\narisen for having his own writing examined, that, being much hurried to\\ncomplete a small affair I had in hand, I abruptly called to Bartleby. In my\\nhaste and natural expectancy of instant compliance, I sat with my head bent\\nover the original on my desk, and my right hand sideways, and somewhat\\nnervously extended with the copy, so that, immediately upon emerging from his\\nretreat, Bartleby might snatch it and proceed to business without the least\\ndelay.', 'In this very attitude did I sit when I called to him, rapidly stating what it\\nwas I wanted him to do—namely, to examine a small paper with me. Imagine\\nmy surprise, nay, my consternation, when, without moving from his privacy,\\nBartleby, in a singularly mild, firm voice, replied, “I would prefer not\\nto.”', 'I sat awhile in perfect silence, rallying my stunned faculties. Immediately it\\noccurred to me that my ears had deceived me, or Bartleby had entirely\\nmisunderstood my meaning. I repeated my request in the clearest tone I could\\nassume; but in quite as clear a one came the previous reply, “I would\\nprefer not to.”', '“Prefer not to,” echoed I, rising in high excitement, and crossing\\nthe room with a stride. “What do you mean? Are you moon-struck? I want\\nyou to help me compare this sheet here—take it,” and I thrust it\\ntowards him.', '“I would prefer not to,” said he.', 'I looked at him steadfastly. His face was leanly composed; his gray eye dimly\\ncalm. Not a wrinkle of agitation rippled him. Had there been the least\\nuneasiness, anger, impatience or impertinence in his manner; in other words,\\nhad there been any thing ordinarily human about him, doubtless I should have\\nviolently dismissed him from the premises. But as it was, I should have as soon\\nthought of turning my pale plaster-of-paris bust of Cicero out of doors. I\\nstood gazing at him awhile, as he went on with his own writing, and then\\nreseated myself at my desk. This is very strange, thought I. What had one best\\ndo? But my business hurried me. I concluded to forget the matter for the\\npresent, reserving it for my future leisure. So calling Nippers from the other\\nroom, the paper was speedily examined.', 'A few days after this, Bartleby concluded four lengthy documents, being\\nquadruplicates of a week’s testimony taken before me in my High Court of\\nChancery. It became necessary to examine them. It was an important suit, and\\ngreat accuracy was imperative. Having all things arranged, I called Turkey,\\nNippers and Ginger Nut, from the next room, meaning to place the four copies in\\nthe hands of my four clerks, while I should read from the original.\\nAccordingly, Turkey, Nippers, and Ginger Nut had taken their seats in a row,\\neach with his document in his hand, when I called to Bartleby to join this\\ninteresting group.', '“Bartleby! quick, I am waiting.”', 'I heard a slow scrape of his chair legs on the uncarpeted floor, and soon he\\nappeared standing at the entrance of his hermitage.', '“What is wanted?” said he, mildly.', '“The copies, the copies,” said I, hurriedly. “We are going to\\nexamine them. There”—and I held towards him the fourth\\nquadruplicate.', '“I would prefer not to,” he said, and gently disappeared behind the\\nscreen.', 'For a few moments I was turned into a pillar of salt, standing at the head of\\nmy seated column of clerks. Recovering myself, I advanced towards the screen,\\nand demanded the reason for such extraordinary conduct.', '“Why do you refuse?”', '“I would prefer not to.”', 'With any other man I should have flown outright into a dreadful passion,\\nscorned all further words, and thrust him ignominiously from my presence. But\\nthere was something about Bartleby that not only strangely disarmed me, but, in\\na wonderful manner, touched and disconcerted me. I began to reason with him.', '“These are your own copies we are about to examine. It is labor saving to\\nyou, because one examination will answer for your four papers. It is common\\nusage. Every copyist is bound to help examine his copy. Is it not so? Will you\\nnot speak? Answer!”', '“I prefer not to,” he replied in a flutelike tone. It seemed to me\\nthat, while I had been addressing him, he carefully revolved every statement\\nthat I made; fully comprehended the meaning; could not gainsay the irresistible\\nconclusion; but, at the same time, some paramount consideration prevailed with\\nhim to reply as he did.', '“You are decided, then, not to comply with my request—a request\\nmade according to common usage and common sense?”', 'He briefly gave me to understand, that on that point my judgment was sound.\\nYes: his decision was irreversible.', 'It is not seldom the case that, when a man is browbeaten in some unprecedented\\nand violently unreasonable way, he begins to stagger in his own plainest faith.\\nHe begins, as it were, vaguely to surmise that, wonderful as it may be, all the\\njustice and all the reason is on the other side. Accordingly, if any\\ndisinterested persons are present, he turns to them for some reinforcement for\\nhis own faltering mind.', '“Turkey,” said I, “what do you think of this? Am I not\\nright?”', '“With submission, sir,” said Turkey, in his blandest tone, “I\\nthink that you are.”', '“Nippers,” said I, “what do you think of it?”', '“I think I should kick him out of the office.”', '(The reader, of nice perceptions, will here perceive that, it being morning,\\nTurkey’s answer is couched in polite and tranquil terms, but Nippers\\nreplies in ill-tempered ones. Or, to repeat a previous sentence,\\nNippers’s ugly mood was on duty, and Turkey’s off.)', '“Ginger Nut,” said I, willing to enlist the smallest suffrage in my\\nbehalf, “what do you think of it?”', '“I think, sir, he’s a little luny,” replied Ginger\\nNut, with a grin.', '“You hear what they say,” said I, turning towards the screen,\\n“come forth and do your duty.”', 'But he vouchsafed no reply. I pondered a moment in sore perplexity. But once\\nmore business hurried me. I determined again to postpone the consideration of\\nthis dilemma to my future leisure. With a little trouble we made out to examine\\nthe papers without Bartleby, though at every page or two Turkey deferentially\\ndropped his opinion, that this proceeding was quite out of the common; while\\nNippers, twitching in his chair with a dyspeptic nervousness, ground out,\\nbetween his set teeth, occasional hissing maledictions against the stubborn oaf\\nbehind the screen. And for his (Nippers’s) part, this was the first and\\nthe last time he would do another man’s business without pay.', 'Meanwhile Bartleby sat in his hermitage, oblivious to everything but his own\\npeculiar business there.', 'Some days passed, the scrivener being employed upon another lengthy work. His\\nlate remarkable conduct led me to regard his ways narrowly. I observed that he\\nnever went to dinner; indeed, that he never went anywhere. As yet I had never,\\nof my personal knowledge, known him to be outside of my office. He was a\\nperpetual sentry in the corner. At about eleven o’clock though, in the\\nmorning, I noticed that Ginger Nut would advance toward the opening in\\nBartleby’s screen, as if silently beckoned thither by a gesture invisible\\nto me where I sat. The boy would then leave the office, jingling a few pence,\\nand reappear with a handful of ginger-nuts, which he delivered in the\\nhermitage, receiving two of the cakes for his trouble.', 'He lives, then, on ginger-nuts, thought I; never eats a dinner, properly\\nspeaking; he must be a vegetarian, then; but no; he never eats even vegetables,\\nhe eats nothing but ginger-nuts. My mind then ran on in reveries concerning the\\nprobable effects upon the human constitution of living entirely on ginger-nuts.\\nGinger-nuts are so called, because they contain ginger as one of their peculiar\\nconstituents, and the final flavoring one. Now, what was ginger? A hot, spicy\\nthing. Was Bartleby hot and spicy? Not at all. Ginger, then, had no effect upon\\nBartleby. Probably, he preferred it should have none.', 'Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the\\nindividual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one\\nperfectly harmless in his passivity, then, in the better moods of the former,\\nhe will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves\\nimpossible to be solved by his judgment. Even so, for the most part, I regarded\\nBartleby and his ways. Poor fellow! thought I, he means no mischief; it is\\nplain he intends no insolence; his aspect sufficiently evinces that his\\neccentricities are involuntary. He is useful to me. I can get along with him.\\nIf I turn him away, the chances are he will fall in with some less-indulgent\\nemployer, and then he will be rudely treated, and perhaps driven forth\\nmiserably to starve. Yes. Here I can cheaply purchase a delicious\\nself-approval. To befriend Bartleby; to humor him in his strange willfulness,\\nwill cost me little or nothing, while I lay up in my soul what will eventually\\nprove a sweet morsel for my conscience. But this mood was not invariable, with\\nme. The passiveness of Bartleby sometimes irritated me. I felt strangely goaded\\non to encounter him in new opposition—to elicit some angry spark from him\\nanswerable to my own. But, indeed, I might as well have essayed to strike fire\\nwith my knuckles against a bit of Windsor soap. But one afternoon the evil\\nimpulse in me mastered me, and the following little scene ensued:', '“Bartleby,” said I, “when those papers are all copied, I will\\ncompare them with you.”', '“I would prefer not to.”', '“How? Surely you do not mean to persist in that mulish vagary?”', 'No answer.', 'I threw open the folding-doors near by, and, turning upon Turkey and Nippers,\\nexclaimed:', '“Bartleby a second time says, he won’t examine his papers. What do\\nyou think of it, Turkey?”', 'It was afternoon, be it remembered. Turkey sat glowing like a brass boiler; his\\nbald head steaming; his hands reeling among his blotted papers.', '“Think of it?” roared Turkey; “I think I’ll just step\\nbehind his screen, and black his eyes for him!”', 'So saying, Turkey rose to his feet and threw his arms into a pugilistic\\nposition. He was hurrying away to make good his promise, when I detained him,\\nalarmed at the effect of incautiously rousing Turkey’s combativeness\\nafter dinner.', '“Sit down, Turkey,” said I, “and hear what Nippers has to\\nsay. What do you think of it, Nippers? Would I not be justified in immediately\\ndismissing Bartleby?”', '“Excuse me, that is for you to decide, sir. I think his conduct quite\\nunusual, and, indeed, unjust, as regards Turkey and myself. But it may only be\\na passing whim.”', '“Ah,” exclaimed I, “you have strangely changed your mind,\\nthen—you speak very gently of him now.”', '“All beer,” cried Turkey; “gentleness is effects of\\nbeer—Nippers and I dined together to-day. You see how gentle I am,\\nsir. Shall I go and black his eyes?”', '“You refer to Bartleby, I suppose. No, not to-day, Turkey,” I\\nreplied; “pray, put up your fists.”', 'I closed the doors, and again advanced towards Bartleby. I felt additional\\nincentives tempting me to my fate. I burned to be rebelled against again. I\\nremembered that Bartleby never left the office.', '“Bartleby,” said I, “Ginger Nut is away; just step around to\\nthe Post Office, won’t you? (it was but a three minutes’ walk), and\\nsee if there is anything for me.”', '“I would prefer not to.”', '“You will not?”', '“I prefer not.”', 'I staggered to my desk, and sat there in a deep study. My blind inveteracy\\nreturned. Was there any other thing in which I could procure myself to be\\nignominiously repulsed by this lean, penniless wight?—my hired clerk?\\nWhat added thing is there, perfectly reasonable, that he will be sure to refuse\\nto do?', '“Bartleby!”', 'No answer.', '“Bartleby,” in a louder tone.', 'No answer.', '“Bartleby,” I roared.', 'Like a very ghost, agreeably to the laws of magical invocation, at the third\\nsummons, he appeared at the entrance of his hermitage.', '“Go to the next room, and tell Nippers to come to me.”', '“I prefer not to,” he respectfully and slowly said, and mildly\\ndisappeared.', '“Very good, Bartleby,” said I, in a quiet sort of serenely-severe\\nself-possessed tone, intimating the unalterable purpose of some terrible\\nretribution very close at hand. At the moment I half intended something of the\\nkind. But upon the whole, as it was drawing towards my dinner-hour, I thought\\nit best to put on my hat and walk home for the day, suffering much from\\nperplexity and distress of mind.', 'Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this whole business was, that it soon\\nbecame a fixed fact of my chambers, that a pale young scrivener, by the name of\\nBartleby, had a desk there; that he copied for me at the usual rate of four\\ncents a folio (one hundred words); but he was permanently exempt from examining\\nthe work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, out of\\ncompliment, doubtless, to their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was\\nnever, on any account, to be dispatched on the most trivial errand of any sort;\\nand that even if entreated to take upon him such a matter, it was generally\\nunderstood that he would “prefer not to”—in other words, that\\nhe would refuse point-blank.', 'As days passed on, I became considerably reconciled to Bartleby. His\\nsteadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except\\nwhen he chose to throw himself into a standing revery behind his screen), his\\ngreat stillness, his unalterableness of demeanor under all circumstances, made\\nhim a valuable acquisition. One prime thing was this—he was always\\nthere—first in the morning, continually through the day, and the last\\nat night. I had a singular confidence in his honesty. I felt my most precious\\npapers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes, to be sure, I could not, for the\\nvery soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him. For it\\nwas exceeding difficult to bear in mind all the time those strange\\npeculiarities, privileges, and unheard of exemptions, forming the tacit\\nstipulations on Bartleby’s part under which he remained in my office. Now\\nand then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would\\ninadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say,\\non the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing\\nsome papers. Of course, from behind the screen the usual answer, “I\\nprefer not to,” was sure to come; and then, how could a human creature,\\nwith the common infirmities of our nature, refrain from bitterly exclaiming\\nupon such perverseness—such unreasonableness. However, every added\\nrepulse of this sort which I received only tended to lessen the probability of\\nmy repeating the inadvertence.', 'Here it must be said, that according to the custom of most legal gentlemen\\noccupying chambers in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys\\nto my door. One was kept by a woman residing in the attic, which person weekly\\nscrubbed and daily swept and dusted my apartments. Another was kept by Turkey\\nfor convenience sake. The third I sometimes carried in my own pocket. The\\nfourth I knew not who had.', 'Now, one Sunday morning I happened to go to Trinity Church, to hear a\\ncelebrated preacher, and finding myself rather early on the ground I thought I\\nwould walk round to my chambers for a while. Luckily I had my key with me; but\\nupon applying it to the lock, I found it resisted by something inserted from\\nthe inside. Quite surprised, I called out; when to my consternation a key was\\nturned from within; and thrusting his lean visage at me, and holding the door\\najar, the apparition of Bartleby appeared, in his shirt sleeves, and otherwise\\nin a strangely tattered deshabille, saying quietly that he was sorry, but he\\nwas deeply engaged just then, and—preferred not admitting me at present.\\nIn a brief word or two, he moreover added, that perhaps I had better walk round\\nthe block two or three times, and by that time he would probably have concluded\\nhis affairs.', 'Now, the utterly unsurmised appearance of Bartleby, tenanting my law-chambers\\nof a Sunday morning, with his cadaverously gentlemanly nonchalance, yet\\nwithal firm and self-possessed, had such a strange effect upon me, that\\nincontinently I slunk away from my own door, and did as desired. But not\\nwithout sundry twinges of impotent rebellion against the mild effrontery of\\nthis unaccountable scrivener. Indeed, it was his wonderful mildness chiefly,\\nwhich not only disarmed me, but unmanned me as it were. For I consider that\\none, for the time, is a sort of unmanned when he tranquilly permits his hired\\nclerk to dictate to him, and order him away from his own premises. Furthermore,\\nI was full of uneasiness as to what Bartleby could possibly be doing in my\\noffice in his shirt sleeves, and in an otherwise dismantled condition of a\\nSunday morning. Was anything amiss going on? Nay, that was out of the question.\\nIt was not to be thought of for a moment that Bartleby was an immoral person.\\nBut what could he be doing there?—copying? Nay again, whatever might be\\nhis eccentricities, Bartleby was an eminently decorous person. He would be the\\nlast man to sit down to his desk in any state approaching to nudity. Besides,\\nit was Sunday; and there was something about Bartleby that forbade the\\nsupposition that he would by any secular occupation violate the proprieties of\\nthe day.', 'Nevertheless, my mind was not pacified; and full of a restless curiosity, at\\nlast I returned to the door. Without hindrance I inserted my key, opened it,\\nand entered. Bartleby was not to be seen. I looked round anxiously, peeped\\nbehind his screen; but it was very plain that he was gone. Upon more closely\\nexamining the place, I surmised that for an indefinite period Bartleby must\\nhave ate, dressed, and slept in my office, and that, too without plate, mirror,\\nor bed. The cushioned seat of a ricketty old sofa in one corner bore the faint\\nimpress of a lean, reclining form. Rolled away under his desk, I found a\\nblanket; under the empty grate, a blacking box and brush; on a chair, a tin\\nbasin, with soap and a ragged towel; in a newspaper a few crumbs of ginger-nuts\\nand a morsel of cheese. Yes, thought I, it is evident enough that Bartleby has\\nbeen making his home here, keeping bachelor’s hall all by himself.\\nImmediately then the thought came sweeping across me, what miserable\\nfriendlessness and loneliness are here revealed! His poverty is great; but his\\nsolitude, how horrible! Think of it. Of a Sunday, Wall-street is deserted as\\nPetra; and every night of every day it is an emptiness. This building, too,\\nwhich of week-days hums with industry and life, at nightfall echoes with sheer\\nvacancy, and all through Sunday is forlorn. And here Bartleby makes his home;\\nsole spectator, of a solitude which he has seen all populous—a sort of\\ninnocent and transformed Marius brooding among the ruins of Carthage!', 'For the first time in my life a feeling of overpowering stinging melancholy\\nseized me. Before, I had never experienced aught but a not unpleasing sadness.\\nThe bond of a common humanity now drew me irresistibly to gloom. A fraternal\\nmelancholy! For both I and Bartleby were sons of Adam. I remembered the bright\\nsilks and sparkling faces I had seen that day, in gala trim, swan-like sailing\\ndown the Mississippi of Broadway; and I contrasted them with the pallid\\ncopyist, and thought to myself, Ah, happiness courts the light, so we deem the\\nworld is gay; but misery hides aloof, so we deem that misery there is none.\\nThese sad fancyings—chimeras, doubtless, of a sick and silly\\nbrain—led on to other and more special thoughts, concerning the\\neccentricities of Bartleby. Presentiments of strange discoveries hovered round\\nme. The scriveners pale form appeared to me laid out, among uncaring strangers,\\nin its shivering winding sheet.', 'Suddenly I was attracted by Bartleby’s closed desk, the key in open sight\\nleft in the lock.', 'I mean no mischief, seek the gratification of no heartless curiosity, thought\\nI; besides, the desk is mine, and its contents, too, so I will make bold to\\nlook within. Everything was methodically arranged, the papers smoothly placed.\\nThe pigeon holes were deep, and removing the files of documents, I groped into\\ntheir recesses. Presently I felt something there, and dragged it out. It was an\\nold bandanna handkerchief, heavy and knotted. I opened it, and saw it was a\\nsavings’ bank.', 'I now recalled all the quiet mysteries which I had noted in the man. I\\nremembered that he never spoke but to answer; that, though at intervals he had\\nconsiderable time to himself, yet I had never seen him reading—no, not\\neven a newspaper; that for long periods he would stand looking out, at his pale\\nwindow behind the screen, upon the dead brick wall; I was quite sure he never\\nvisited any refectory or eating house; while his pale face clearly indicated\\nthat he never drank beer like Turkey, or tea and coffee even, like other men;\\nthat he never went anywhere in particular that I could learn; never went out\\nfor a walk, unless, indeed, that was the case at present; that he had declined\\ntelling who he was, or whence he came, or whether he had any relatives in the\\nworld; that though so thin and pale, he never complained of ill health. And\\nmore than all, I remembered a certain unconscious air of pallid—how shall\\nI call it?—of pallid haughtiness, say, or rather an austere reserve about\\nhim, which had positively awed me into my tame compliance with his\\neccentricities, when I had feared to ask him to do the slightest incidental\\nthing for me, even though I might know, from his long-continued motionlessness,\\nthat behind his screen he must be standing in one of those dead-wall reveries\\nof his.', 'Revolving all these things, and coupling them with the recently discovered\\nfact, that he made my office his constant abiding place and home, and not\\nforgetful of his morbid moodiness; revolving all these things, a prudential\\nfeeling began to steal over me. My first emotions had been those of pure\\nmelancholy and sincerest pity; but just in proportion as the forlornness of\\nBartleby grew and grew to my imagination, did that same melancholy merge into\\nfear, that pity into repulsion. So true it is, and so terrible, too, that up to\\na certain point the thought or sight of misery enlists our best affections;\\nbut, in certain special cases, beyond that point it does not. They err who\\nwould assert that invariably this is owing to the inherent selfishness of the\\nhuman heart. It rather proceeds from a certain hopelessness of remedying\\nexcessive and organic ill. To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And\\nwhen at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor,\\ncommon sense bids the soul be rid of it. What I saw that morning persuaded me\\nthat the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder. I might\\ngive alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that\\nsuffered, and his soul I could not reach.', 'I did not accomplish the purpose of going to Trinity Church that morning.\\nSomehow, the things I had seen disqualified me for the time from church-going.\\nI walked homeward, thinking what I would do with Bartleby. Finally, I resolved\\nupon this—I would put certain calm questions to him the next morning,\\ntouching his history, etc., and if he declined to answer them openly and\\nunreservedly (and I supposed he would prefer not), then to give him a twenty\\ndollar bill over and above whatever I might owe him, and tell him his services\\nwere no longer required; but that if in any other way I could assist him, I\\nwould be happy to do so, especially if he desired to return to his native\\nplace, wherever that might be, I would willingly help to defray the expenses.\\nMoreover, if, after reaching home, he found himself at any time in want of aid,\\na letter from him would be sure of a reply.', 'The next morning came.', '“Bartleby,” said I, gently calling to him behind his screen.', 'No reply.', '“Bartleby,” said I, in a still gentler tone, “come here; I am\\nnot going to ask you to do anything you would prefer not to do—I simply\\nwish to speak to you.”', 'Upon this he noiselessly slid into view.', '“Will you tell me, Bartleby, where you were born?”', '“I would prefer not to.”', '“Will you tell me anything about yourself?”', '“I would prefer not to.”', '“But what reasonable objection can you have to speak to me? I feel\\nfriendly towards you.”', 'He did not look at me while I spoke, but kept his glance fixed upon my bust of\\nCicero, which, as I then sat, was directly behind me, some six inches above my\\nhead.', '“What is your answer, Bartleby,” said I, after waiting a\\nconsiderable time for a reply, during which his countenance remained immovable,\\nonly there was the faintest conceivable tremor of the white attenuated mouth.', '“At present I prefer to give no answer,” he said, and retired into\\nhis hermitage.', 'It was rather weak in me I confess, but his manner, on this occasion, nettled\\nme. Not only did there seem to lurk in it a certain calm disdain, but his\\nperverseness seemed ungrateful, considering the undeniable good usage and\\nindulgence he had received from me.', 'Again I sat ruminating what I should do. Mortified as I was at his behavior,\\nand resolved as I had been to dismiss him when I entered my office,\\nnevertheless I strangely felt something superstitious knocking at my heart, and\\nforbidding me to carry out my purpose, and denouncing me for a villain if I\\ndared to breathe one bitter word against this forlornest of mankind. At last,\\nfamiliarly drawing my chair behind his screen, I sat down and said:\\n“Bartleby, never mind, then, about revealing your history; but let me\\nentreat you, as a friend, to comply as far as may be with the usages of this\\noffice. Say now, you will help to examine papers to-morrow or next day: in\\nshort, say now, that in a day or two you will begin to be a little\\nreasonable:—say so, Bartleby.”', '“At present I would prefer not to be a little reasonable,” was his\\nmildly cadaverous reply.', 'Just then the folding-doors opened, and Nippers approached. He seemed suffering\\nfrom an unusually bad night’s rest, induced by severer indigestion than\\ncommon. He overheard those final words of Bartleby.', '“Prefer not, eh?” gritted Nippers—“I’d\\nprefer him, if I were you, sir,” addressing\\nme—“I’d prefer him; I’d give him preferences,\\nthe stubborn mule! What is it, sir, pray, that he prefers not to do\\nnow?”', 'Bartleby moved not a limb.', '“Mr. Nippers,” said I, “I’d prefer that you would\\nwithdraw for the present.”', 'Somehow, of late, I had got into the way of involuntarily using this word\\n“prefer” upon all sorts of not exactly suitable occasions. And I\\ntrembled to think that my contact with the scrivener had already and seriously\\naffected me in a mental way. And what further and deeper aberration might it\\nnot yet produce? This apprehension had not been without efficacy in determining\\nme to summary measures.', 'As Nippers, looking very sour and sulky, was departing, Turkey blandly and\\ndeferentially approached.', '“With submission, sir,” said he, “yesterday I was thinking\\nabout Bartleby here, and I think that if he would but prefer to take a quart of\\ngood ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to\\nassist in examining his papers.”', '“So you have got the word, too,” said I, slightly excited.', '“With submission, what word, sir,” asked Turkey, respectfully\\ncrowding himself into the contracted space behind the screen, and by so doing,\\nmaking me jostle the scrivener. “What word, sir?”', '“I would prefer to be left alone here,” said Bartleby, as if\\noffended at being mobbed in his privacy.', '“That’s the word, Turkey,” said\\nI—“that’s it.”', '“Oh, prefer? oh yes—queer word. I never use it myself. But,\\nsir, as I was saying, if he would but prefer—”', '“Turkey,” interrupted I, “you will please withdraw.”', '“Oh certainly, sir, if you prefer that I should.”', 'As he opened the folding-door to retire, Nippers at his desk caught a glimpse\\nof me, and asked whether I would prefer to have a certain paper copied on blue\\npaper or white. He did not in the least roguishly accent the word prefer. It\\nwas plain that it involuntarily rolled from his tongue. I thought to myself,\\nsurely I must get rid of a demented man, who already has in some degree turned\\nthe tongues, if not the heads of myself and clerks. But I thought it prudent\\nnot to break the dismission at once.', 'The next day I noticed that Bartleby did nothing but stand at his window in his\\ndead-wall revery. Upon asking him why he did not write, he said that he had\\ndecided upon doing no more writing.', '“Why, how now? what next?” exclaimed I, “do no more\\nwriting?”', '“No more.”', '“And what is the reason?”', '“Do you not see the reason for yourself,” he indifferently replied.', 'I looked steadfastly at him, and perceived that his eyes looked dull and\\nglazed. Instantly it occurred to me, that his unexampled diligence in copying\\nby his dim window for the first few weeks of his stay with me might have\\ntemporarily impared his vision.', 'I was touched. I said something in condolence with him. I hinted that of course\\nhe did wisely in abstaining from writing for a while; and urged him to embrace\\nthat opportunity of taking wholesome exercise in the open air. This, however,\\nhe did not do. A few days after this, my other clerks being absent, and being\\nin a great hurry to dispatch certain letters by the mail, I thought that,\\nhaving nothing else earthly to do, Bartleby would surely be less inflexible\\nthan usual, and carry these letters to the post-office. But he blankly\\ndeclined. So, much to my inconvenience, I went myself.', 'Still added days went by. Whether Bartleby’s eyes improved or not, I\\ncould not say. To all appearance, I thought they did. But when I asked him if\\nthey did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, he would do no copying. At\\nlast, in reply to my urgings, he informed me that he had permanently given up\\ncopying.', '“What!” exclaimed I; “suppose your eyes should get entirely\\nwell—better than ever before—would you not copy then?”', '“I have given up copying,” he answered, and slid aside.', 'He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nay—if that were\\npossible—he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be\\ndone? He would do nothing in the office; why should he stay there? In plain\\nfact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but\\nafflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less than truth when I say\\nthat, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have\\nnamed a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged\\ntheir taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed\\nalone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At\\nlength, necessities connected with my business tyrannized over all other\\nconsiderations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that in six days time he\\nmust unconditionally leave the office. I warned him to take measures, in the\\ninterval, for procuring some other abode. I offered to assist him in this\\nendeavor, if he himself would but take the first step towards a removal.\\n“And when you finally quit me, Bartleby,” added I, “I shall\\nsee that you go not away entirely unprovided. Six days from this hour,\\nremember.”', 'At the expiration of that period, I peeped behind the screen, and lo! Bartleby\\nwas there.', 'I buttoned up my coat, balanced myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched\\nhis shoulder, and said, “The time has come; you must quit this place; I\\nam sorry for you; here is money; but you must go.”', '“I would prefer not,” he replied, with his back still towards me.', '“You must.”', 'He remained silent.', 'Now I had an unbounded confidence in this man’s common honesty. He had\\nfrequently restored to me sixpences and shillings carelessly dropped upon the\\nfloor, for I am apt to be very reckless in such shirt-button affairs. The\\nproceeding, then, which followed will not be deemed extraordinary.', '“Bartleby,” said I, “I owe you twelve dollars on account;\\nhere are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours—Will you take it?”\\nand I handed the bills towards him.', 'But he made no motion.', '“I will leave them here, then,” putting them under a weight on the\\ntable. Then taking my hat and cane and going to the door, I tranquilly turned\\nand added—“After you have removed your things from these offices,\\nBartleby, you will of course lock the door—since every one is now gone\\nfor the day but you—and if you please, slip your key underneath the mat,\\nso that I may have it in the morning. I shall not see you again; so good-by to\\nyou. If, hereafter, in your new place of abode, I can be of any service to you,\\ndo not fail to advise me by letter. Good-by, Bartleby, and fare you\\nwell.”', 'But he answered not a word; like the last column of some ruined temple, he\\nremained standing mute and solitary in the middle of the otherwise deserted\\nroom.', 'As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I\\ncould not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of\\nBartleby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate\\nthinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness.\\nThere was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring,\\nand striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for\\nBartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind.\\nWithout loudly bidding Bartleby depart—as an inferior genius might have\\ndone—I assumed the ground that depart he must; and upon that\\nassumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the\\nmore I was charmed with it. Nevertheless, next morning, upon awakening, I had\\nmy doubts—I had somehow slept off the fumes of vanity. One of the coolest\\nand wisest hours a man has, is just after he awakes in the morning. My\\nprocedure seemed as sagacious as ever—but only in theory. How it would\\nprove in practice—there was the rub. It was truly a beautiful thought to\\nhave assumed Bartleby’s departure; but, after all, that assumption was\\nsimply my own, and none of Bartleby’s. The great point was, not whether I\\nhad assumed that he would quit me, but whether he would prefer so to do. He was\\nmore a man of preferences than assumptions.', 'After breakfast, I walked down town, arguing the probabilities pro and\\ncon. One moment I thought it would prove a miserable failure, and\\nBartleby would be found all alive at my office as usual; the next moment it\\nseemed certain that I should find his chair empty. And so I kept veering about.\\nAt the corner of Broadway and Canal street, I saw quite an excited group of\\npeople standing in earnest conversation.', '“I’ll take odds he doesn’t,” said a voice as I passed.', '“Doesn’t go?—done!” said I, “put up your\\nmoney.”', 'I was instinctively putting my hand in my pocket to produce my own, when I\\nremembered that this was an election day. The words I had overheard bore no\\nreference to Bartleby, but to the success or non-success of some candidate for\\nthe mayoralty. In my intent frame of mind, I had, as it were, imagined that all\\nBroadway shared in my excitement, and were debating the same question with me.\\nI passed on, very thankful that the uproar of the street screened my momentary\\nabsent-mindedness.', 'As I had intended, I was earlier than usual at my office door. I stood\\nlistening for a moment. All was still. He must be gone. I tried the knob. The\\ndoor was locked. Yes, my procedure had worked to a charm; he indeed must be\\nvanished. Yet a certain melancholy mixed with this: I was almost sorry for my\\nbrilliant success. I was fumbling under the door mat for the key, which\\nBartleby was to have left there for me, when accidentally my knee knocked\\nagainst a panel, producing a summoning sound, and in response a voice came to\\nme from within—“Not yet; I am occupied.”', 'It was Bartleby.', 'I was thunderstruck. For an instant I stood like the man who, pipe in mouth,\\nwas killed one cloudless afternoon long ago in Virginia, by summer lightning;\\nat his own warm open window he was killed, and remained leaning out there upon\\nthe dreamy afternoon till some one touched him, when he fell.', '“Not gone!” I murmured at last. But again obeying that wondrous\\nascendancy which the inscrutable scrivener had over me, and from which\\nascendancy, for all my chafing, I could not completely escape, I slowly went\\ndown stairs and out into the street, and while walking round the block,\\nconsidered what I should next do in this unheard-of perplexity. Turn the man\\nout by an actual thrusting I could not; to drive him away by calling him hard\\nnames would not do; calling in the police was an unpleasant idea; and yet,\\npermit him to enjoy his cadaverous triumph over me—this, too, I could not\\nthink of. What was to be done? or, if nothing could be done, was there anything\\nfurther that I could assume in the matter? Yes, as before I had\\nprospectively assumed that Bartleby would depart, so now I might\\nretrospectively assume that departed he was. In the legitimate carrying out of\\nthis assumption, I might enter my office in a great hurry, and pretending not\\nto see Bartleby at all, walk straight against him as if he were air. Such a\\nproceeding would in a singular degree have the appearance of a home-thrust. It\\nwas hardly possible that Bartleby could withstand such an application of the\\ndoctrine of assumptions. But upon second thoughts the success of the plan\\nseemed rather dubious. I resolved to argue the matter over with him again.', '“Bartleby,” said I, entering the office, with a quietly severe\\nexpression, “I am seriously displeased. I am pained, Bartleby. I had\\nthought better of you. I had imagined you of such a gentlemanly organization,\\nthat in any delicate dilemma a slight hint would suffice—in short, an\\nassumption. But it appears I am deceived. Why,” I added, unaffectedly\\nstarting, “you have not even touched that money yet,” pointing to\\nit, just where I had left it the evening previous.', 'He answered nothing.', '“Will you, or will you not, quit me?” I now demanded in a sudden\\npassion, advancing close to him.', '“I would prefer not to quit you,” he replied gently\\nemphasizing the not.', '“What earthly right have you to stay here? Do you pay any rent? Do you\\npay my taxes? Or is this property yours?”', 'He answered nothing.', '“Are you ready to go on and write now? Are your eyes recovered? Could you\\ncopy a small paper for me this morning? or help examine a few lines? or step\\nround to the post-office? In a word, will you do anything at all, to give a\\ncoloring to your refusal to depart the premises?”', 'He silently retired into his hermitage.', 'I was now in such a state of nervous resentment that I thought it but prudent\\nto check myself at present from further demonstrations. Bartleby and I were\\nalone. I remembered the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more\\nunfortunate Colt in the solitary office of the latter; and how poor Colt, being\\ndreadfully incensed by Adams, and imprudently permitting himself to get wildly\\nexcited, was at unawares hurried into his fatal act—an act which\\ncertainly no man could possibly deplore more than the actor himself. Often it\\nhad occurred to me in my ponderings upon the subject, that had that altercation\\ntaken place in the public street, or at a private residence, it would not have\\nterminated as it did. It was the circumstance of being alone in a solitary\\noffice, up stairs, of a building entirely unhallowed by humanizing domestic\\nassociations—an uncarpeted office, doubtless, of a dusty, haggard sort of\\nappearance—this it must have been, which greatly helped to enhance the\\nirritable desperation of the hapless Colt.', 'But when this old Adam of resentment rose in me and tempted me concerning\\nBartleby, I grappled him and threw him. How? Why, simply by recalling the\\ndivine injunction: “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one\\nanother.” Yes, this it was that saved me. Aside from higher\\nconsiderations, charity often operates as a vastly wise and prudent\\nprinciple—a great safeguard to its possessor. Men have committed murder\\nfor jealousy’s sake, and anger’s sake, and hatred’s sake, and\\nselfishness’ sake, and spiritual pride’s sake; but no man, that\\never I heard of, ever committed a diabolical murder for sweet charity’s\\nsake. Mere self-interest, then, if no better motive can be enlisted, should,\\nespecially with high-tempered men, prompt all beings to charity and\\nphilanthropy. At any rate, upon the occasion in question, I strove to drown my\\nexasperated feelings towards the scrivener by benevolently construing his\\nconduct.—Poor fellow, poor fellow! thought I, he don’t mean\\nanything; and besides, he has seen hard times, and ought to be indulged.', 'I endeavored, also, immediately to occupy myself, and at the same time to\\ncomfort my despondency. I tried to fancy, that in the course of the morning, at\\nsuch time as might prove agreeable to him, Bartleby, of his own free accord,\\nwould emerge from his hermitage and take up some decided line of march in the\\ndirection of the door. But no. Half-past twelve o’clock came; Turkey\\nbegan to glow in the face, overturn his inkstand, and become generally\\nobstreperous; Nippers abated down into quietude and courtesy; Ginger Nut\\nmunched his noon apple; and Bartleby remained standing at his window in one of\\nhis profoundest dead-wall reveries. Will it be credited? Ought I to acknowledge\\nit? That afternoon I left the office without saying one further word to him.', 'Some days now passed, during which, at leisure intervals I looked a little into\\n“Edwards on the Will,” and “Priestley on Necessity.”\\nUnder the circumstances, those books induced a salutary feeling. Gradually I\\nslid into the persuasion that these troubles of mine, touching the scrivener,\\nhad been all predestinated from eternity, and Bartleby was billeted upon me for\\nsome mysterious purpose of an allwise Providence, which it was not for a mere\\nmortal like me to fathom. Yes, Bartleby, stay there behind your screen, thought\\nI; I shall persecute you no more; you are harmless and noiseless as any of\\nthese old chairs; in short, I never feel so private as when I know you are\\nhere. At last I see it, I feel it; I penetrate to the predestinated purpose of\\nmy life. I am content. Others may have loftier parts to enact; but my mission\\nin this world, Bartleby, is to furnish you with office-room for such period as\\nyou may see fit to remain.', 'I believe that this wise and blessed frame of mind would have continued with\\nme, had it not been for the unsolicited and uncharitable remarks obtruded upon\\nme by my professional friends who visited the rooms. But thus it often is, that\\nthe constant friction of illiberal minds wears out at last the best resolves of\\nthe more generous. Though to be sure, when I reflected upon it, it was not\\nstrange that people entering my office should be struck by the peculiar aspect\\nof the unaccountable Bartleby, and so be tempted to throw out some sinister\\nobservations concerning him. Sometimes an attorney, having business with me,\\nand calling at my office, and finding no one but the scrivener there, would\\nundertake to obtain some sort of precise information from him touching my\\nwhereabouts; but without heeding his idle talk, Bartleby would remain standing\\nimmovable in the middle of the room. So after contemplating him in that\\nposition for a time, the attorney would depart, no wiser than he came.', 'Also, when a reference was going on, and the room full of lawyers and\\nwitnesses, and business driving fast, some deeply-occupied legal gentleman\\npresent, seeing Bartleby wholly unemployed, would request him to run round to\\nhis (the legal gentleman’s) office and fetch some papers for him.\\nThereupon, Bartleby would tranquilly decline, and yet remain idle as before.\\nThen the lawyer would give a great stare, and turn to me. And what could I say?\\nAt last I was made aware that all through the circle of my professional\\nacquaintance, a whisper of wonder was running round, having reference to the\\nstrange creature I kept at my office. This worried me very much. And as the\\nidea came upon me of his possibly turning out a long-lived man, and keep\\noccupying my chambers, and denying my authority; and perplexing my visitors;\\nand scandalizing my professional reputation; and casting a general gloom over\\nthe premises; keeping soul and body together to the last upon his savings (for\\ndoubtless he spent but half a dime a day), and in the end perhaps outlive me,\\nand claim possession of my office by right of his perpetual occupancy: as all\\nthese dark anticipations crowded upon me more and more, and my friends\\ncontinually intruded their relentless remarks upon the apparition in my room; a\\ngreat change was wrought in me. I resolved to gather all my faculties together,\\nand forever rid me of this intolerable incubus.', 'Ere revolving any complicated project, however, adapted to this end, I first\\nsimply suggested to Bartleby the propriety of his permanent departure. In a\\ncalm and serious tone, I commanded the idea to his careful and mature\\nconsideration. But, having taken three days to meditate upon it, he apprised\\nme, that his original determination remained the same; in short, that he still\\npreferred to abide with me.', 'What shall I do? I now said to myself, buttoning up my coat to the last button.\\nWhat shall I do? what ought I to do? what does conscience say I should\\ndo with this man, or, rather, ghost. Rid myself of him, I must; go, he shall.\\nBut how? You will not thrust him, the poor, pale, passive mortal—you will\\nnot thrust such a helpless creature out of your door? you will not dishonor\\nyourself by such cruelty? No, I will not, I cannot do that. Rather would I let\\nhim live and die here, and then mason up his remains in the wall. What, then,\\nwill you do? For all your coaxing, he will not budge. Bribes he leaves under\\nyour own paper-weight on your table; in short, it is quite plain that he\\nprefers to cling to you.', 'Then something severe, something unusual must be done. What! surely you will\\nnot have him collared by a constable, and commit his innocent pallor to the\\ncommon jail? And upon what ground could you procure such a thing to be\\ndone?—a vagrant, is he? What! he a vagrant, a wanderer, who refuses to\\nbudge? It is because he will not be a vagrant, then, that you seek to\\ncount him as a vagrant. That is too absurd. No visible means of support:\\nthere I have him. Wrong again: for indubitably he does support himself,\\nand that is the only unanswerable proof that any man can show of his possessing\\nthe means so to do. No more, then. Since he will not quit me, I must quit him.\\nI will change my offices; I will move elsewhere, and give him fair notice, that\\nif I find him on my new premises I will then proceed against him as a common\\ntrespasser.', 'Acting accordingly, next day I thus addressed him: “I find these chambers\\ntoo far from the City Hall; the air is unwholesome. In a word, I propose to\\nremove my offices next week, and shall no longer require your services. I tell\\nyou this now, in order that you may seek another place.”', 'He made no reply, and nothing more was said.', 'On the appointed day I engaged carts and men, proceeded to my chambers, and,\\nhaving but little furniture, everything was removed in a few hours. Throughout,\\nthe scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I directed to be\\nremoved the last thing. It was withdrawn; and, being folded up like a huge\\nfolio, left him the motionless occupant of a naked room. I stood in the entry\\nwatching him a moment, while something from within me upbraided me.', 'I re-entered, with my hand in my pocket—and—and my heart in my\\nmouth.', '“Good-by, Bartleby; I am going—good-by, and God some way bless you;\\nand take that,” slipping something in his hand. But it dropped upon the\\nfloor, and then—strange to say—I tore myself from him whom I had so\\nlonged to be rid of.', 'Established in my new quarters, for a day or two I kept the door locked, and\\nstarted at every footfall in the passages. When I returned to my rooms, after\\nany little absence, I would pause at the threshold for an instant, and\\nattentively listen, ere applying my key. But these fears were needless.\\nBartleby never came nigh me.', 'I thought all was going well, when a perturbed-looking stranger visited me,\\ninquiring whether I was the person who had recently occupied rooms at No.\\n—— Wall street.', 'Full of forebodings, I replied that I was.', '“Then, sir,” said the stranger, who proved a lawyer, “you are\\nresponsible for the man you left there. He refuses to do any copying; he\\nrefuses to do anything; he says he prefers not to; and he refuses to quit the\\npremises.”', '“I am very sorry, sir,” said I, with assumed tranquillity, but an\\ninward tremor, “but, really, the man you allude to is nothing to\\nme—he is no relation or apprentice of mine, that you should hold me\\nresponsible for him.”', '“In mercy’s name, who is he?”', '“I certainly cannot inform you. I know nothing about him. Formerly I\\nemployed him as a copyist; but he has done nothing for me now for some time\\npast.”', '“I shall settle him, then—good morning, sir.”', 'Several days passed, and I heard nothing more; and, though I often felt a\\ncharitable prompting to call at the place and see poor Bartleby, yet a certain\\nsqueamishness, of I know not what, withheld me.', 'All is over with him, by this time, thought I, at last, when, through another\\nweek, no further intelligence reached me. But, coming to my room the day after,\\nI found several persons waiting at my door in a high state of nervous\\nexcitement.', '“That’s the man—here he comes,” cried the foremost one,\\nwhom I recognized as the lawyer who had previously called upon me alone.', '“You must take him away, sir, at once,” cried a portly person among\\nthem, advancing upon me, and whom I knew to be the landlord of No.\\n—— Wall street. “These gentlemen, my tenants, cannot stand it\\nany longer; Mr. B——,” pointing to the lawyer, “has\\nturned him out of his room, and he now persists in haunting the building\\ngenerally, sitting upon the banisters of the stairs by day, and sleeping in the\\nentry by night. Everybody is concerned; clients are leaving the offices; some\\nfears are entertained of a mob; something you must do, and that without\\ndelay.”', 'Aghast at this torrent, I fell back before it, and would fain have locked\\nmyself in my new quarters. In vain I persisted that Bartleby was nothing to\\nme—no more than to any one else. In vain—I was the last person\\nknown to have anything to do with him, and they held me to the terrible\\naccount. Fearful, then, of being exposed in the papers (as one person present\\nobscurely threatened), I considered the matter, and, at length, said, that if\\nthe lawyer would give me a confidential interview with the scrivener, in his\\n(the lawyer’s) own room, I would, that afternoon, strive my best to rid\\nthem of the nuisance they complained of.', 'Going up stairs to my old haunt, there was Bartleby silently sitting upon the\\nbanister at the landing.', '“What are you doing here, Bartleby?” said I.', '“Sitting upon the banister,” he mildly replied.', 'I motioned him into the lawyer’s room, who then left us.', '“Bartleby” said I, “are you aware that you are the cause of\\ngreat tribulation to me, by persisting in occupying the entry after being\\ndismissed from the office?”', 'No answer.', '“Now one of two things must take place. Either you must do something, or\\nsomething must be done to you. Now what sort of business would you like to\\nengage in? Would you like to re-engage in copying for some one?”', '“No; I would prefer not to make any change.”', '“Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?”', '“There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like a\\nclerkship; but I am not particular.”', '“Too much confinement,” I cried, “why you keep yourself\\nconfined all the time!”', '“I would prefer not to take a clerkship,” he rejoined, as if to\\nsettle that little item at once.', '“How would a bar-tender’s business suit you? There is no trying of\\nthe eye-sight in that.”', '“I would not like it at all; though, as I said before, I am not\\nparticular.”', 'His unwonted wordiness inspirited me. I returned to the charge.', '“Well, then, would you like to travel through the country collecting\\nbills for the merchants? That would improve your health.”', '“No, I would prefer to be doing something else.”', '“How, then, would going as a companion to Europe, to entertain some young\\ngentleman with your conversation—how would that suit you?”', '“Not at all. It does not strike me that there is anything definite about\\nthat. I like to be stationary. But I am not particular.”', '“Stationary you shall be, then,” I cried, now losing all patience,\\nand, for the first time in all my exasperating connection with him, fairly\\nflying into a passion. “If you do not go away from these premises before\\nnight, I shall feel bound—indeed, I am\\nbound—to—to—to quit the premises myself!” I rather\\nabsurdly concluded, knowing not with what possible threat to try to frighten\\nhis immobility into compliance. Despairing of all further efforts, I was\\nprecipitately leaving him, when a final thought occurred to me—one which\\nhad not been wholly unindulged before.', '“Bartleby,” said I, in the kindest tone I could assume under such\\nexciting circumstances, “will you go home with me now—not to my\\noffice, but my dwelling—and remain there till we can conclude upon some\\nconvenient arrangement for you at our leisure? Come, let us start now, right\\naway.”', '“No: at present I would prefer not to make any change at all.”', 'I answered nothing; but, effectually dodging every one by the suddenness and\\nrapidity of my flight, rushed from the building, ran up Wall street towards\\nBroadway, and, jumping into the first omnibus, was soon removed from pursuit.\\nAs soon as tranquillity returned, I distinctly perceived that I had now done\\nall that I possibly could, both in respect to the demands of the landlord and\\nhis tenants, and with regard to my own desire and sense of duty, to benefit\\nBartleby, and shield him from rude persecution, I now strove to be entirely\\ncare-free and quiescent; and my conscience justified me in the attempt; though,\\nindeed, it was not so successful as I could have wished. So fearful was I of\\nbeing again hunted out by the incensed landlord and his exasperated tenants,\\nthat, surrendering my business to Nippers, for a few days, I drove about the\\nupper part of the town and through the suburbs, in my rockaway; crossed over to\\nJersey City and Hoboken, and paid fugitive visits to Manhattanville and\\nAstoria. In fact, I almost lived in my rockaway for the time.', 'When again I entered my office, lo, a note from the landlord lay upon the desk.\\nI opened it with trembling hands. It informed me that the writer had sent to\\nthe police, and had Bartleby removed to the Tombs as a vagrant. Moreover, since\\nI knew more about him than any one else, he wished me to appear at that place,\\nand make a suitable statement of the facts. These tidings had a conflicting\\neffect upon me. At first I was indignant; but, at last, almost approved. The\\nlandlord’s energetic, summary disposition, had led him to adopt a\\nprocedure which I do not think I would have decided upon myself; and yet, as a\\nlast resort, under such peculiar circumstances, it seemed the only plan.', 'As I afterwards learned, the poor scrivener, when told that he must be\\nconducted to the Tombs, offered not the slightest obstacle, but, in his pale,\\nunmoving way, silently acquiesced.', 'Some of the compassionate and curious bystanders joined the party; and headed\\nby one of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby, the silent procession filed\\nits way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares\\nat noon.', 'The same day I received the note, I went to the Tombs, or, to speak more\\nproperly, the Halls of Justice. Seeking the right officer, I stated the purpose\\nof my call, and was informed that the individual I described was, indeed,\\nwithin. I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was a perfectly honest\\nman, and greatly to be compassionated, however unaccountably eccentric. I\\nnarrated all I knew and closed by suggesting the idea of letting him remain in\\nas indulgent confinement as possible, till something less harsh might be\\ndone—though, indeed, I hardly knew what. At all events, if nothing else\\ncould be decided upon, the alms-house must receive him. I then begged to have\\nan interview.', 'Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all his\\nways, they had permitted him freely to wander about the prison, and,\\nespecially, in the inclosed grass-platted yards thereof. And so I found him\\nthere, standing all alone in the quietest of the yards, his face towards a high\\nwall, while all around, from the narrow slits of the jail windows, I thought I\\nsaw peering out upon him the eyes of murderers and thieves.', '“Bartleby!”', '“I know you,” he said, without looking round—“and I\\nwant nothing to say to you.”', '“It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,” said I, keenly\\npained at his implied suspicion. “And to you, this should not be so vile\\na place. Nothing reproachful attaches to you by being here. And see, it is not\\nso sad a place as one might think. Look, there is the sky, and here is the\\ngrass.”', '“I know where I am,” he replied, but would say nothing more, and so\\nI left him.', 'As I entered the corridor again, a broad meat-like man, in an apron, accosted\\nme, and, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, said—“Is that your\\nfriend?”', '“Yes.”', '“Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on the prison fare,\\nthat’s all.”', '“Who are you?” asked I, not knowing what to make of such an\\nunofficially speaking person in such a place.', '“I am the grub-man. Such gentlemen as have friends here, hire me to\\nprovide them with something good to eat.”', '“Is this so?” said I, turning to the turnkey.', 'He said it was.', '“Well, then,” said I, slipping some silver into the\\ngrub-man’s hands (for so they called him), “I want you to give\\nparticular attention to my friend there; let him have the best dinner you can\\nget. And you must be as polite to him as possible.”', '“Introduce me, will you?” said the grub-man, looking at me with an\\nexpression which seem to say he was all impatience for an opportunity to give a\\nspecimen of his breeding.', 'Thinking it would prove of benefit to the scrivener, I acquiesced; and, asking\\nthe grub-man his name, went up with him to Bartleby.', '“Bartleby, this is a friend; you will find him very useful to you.”', '“Your sarvant, sir, your sarvant,” said the grub-man, making a low\\nsalutation behind his apron. “Hope you find it pleasant here, sir; nice\\ngrounds—cool apartments—hope you’ll stay with us some\\ntime—try to make it agreeable. What will you have for dinner\\nto-day?”', '“I prefer not to dine to-day,” said Bartleby, turning away.\\n“It would disagree with me; I am unused to dinners.” So saying, he\\nslowly moved to the other side of the inclosure, and took up a position\\nfronting the dead-wall.', '“How’s this?” said the grub-man, addressing me with a stare\\nof astonishment. “He’s odd, ain’t he?”', '“I think he is a little deranged,” said I, sadly.', '“Deranged? deranged is it? Well, now, upon my word, I thought that friend\\nof yourn was a gentleman forger; they are always pale, and genteel-like, them\\nforgers. I can’t help pity ’em—can’t help it, sir. Did\\nyou know Monroe Edwards?” he added, touchingly, and paused. Then, laying\\nhis hand piteously on my shoulder, sighed, “he died of consumption at\\nSing-Sing. So you weren’t acquainted with Monroe?”', '“No, I was never socially acquainted with any forgers. But I cannot stop\\nlonger. Look to my friend yonder. You will not lose by it. I will see you\\nagain.”', 'Some few days after this, I again obtained admission to the Tombs, and went\\nthrough the corridors in quest of Bartleby; but without finding him.', '“I saw him coming from his cell not long ago,” said a turnkey,\\n“may be he’s gone to loiter in the yards.”', 'So I went in that direction.', '“Are you looking for the silent man?” said another turnkey, passing\\nme. “Yonder he lies—sleeping in the yard there. ’Tis not\\ntwenty minutes since I saw him lie down.”', 'The yard was entirely quiet. It was not accessible to the common prisoners. The\\nsurrounding walls, of amazing thickness, kept off all sounds behind them. The\\nEgyptian character of the masonry weighed upon me with its gloom. But a soft\\nimprisoned turf grew under foot. The heart of the eternal pyramids, it seemed,\\nwherein, by some strange magic, through the clefts, grass-seed, dropped by\\nbirds, had sprung.', 'Strangely huddled at the base of the wall, his knees drawn up, and lying on his\\nside, his head touching the cold stones, I saw the wasted Bartleby. But nothing\\nstirred. I paused; then went close up to him; stooped over, and saw that his\\ndim eyes were open; otherwise he seemed profoundly sleeping. Something prompted\\nme to touch him. I felt his hand, when a tingling shiver ran up my arm and down\\nmy spine to my feet.', 'The round face of the grub-man peered upon me now. “His dinner is ready.\\nWon’t he dine to-day, either? Or does he live without dining?”', '“Lives without dining,” said I, and closed the eyes.', '“Eh!—He’s asleep, ain’t he?”', '“With kings and counselors,” murmured I.', 'There would seem little need for proceeding further in this history.\\nImagination will readily supply the meagre recital of poor Bartleby’s\\ninterment. But, ere parting with the reader, let me say, that if this little\\nnarrative has sufficiently interested him, to awaken curiosity as to who\\nBartleby was, and what manner of life he led prior to the present\\nnarrator’s making his acquaintance, I can only reply, that in such\\ncuriosity I fully share, but am wholly unable to gratify it. Yet here I hardly\\nknow whether I should divulge one little item of rumor, which came to my ear a\\nfew months after the scrivener’s decease. Upon what basis it rested, I\\ncould never ascertain; and hence, how true it is I cannot now tell. But,\\ninasmuch as this vague report has not been without a certain suggestive\\ninterest to me, however sad, it may prove the same with some others; and so I\\nwill briefly mention it. The report was this: that Bartleby had been a\\nsubordinate clerk in the Dead Letter Office at Washington, from which he had\\nbeen suddenly removed by a change in the administration. When I think over this\\nrumor, hardly can I express the emotions which seize me. Dead letters! does it\\nnot sound like dead men? Conceive a man by nature and misfortune prone to a\\npallid hopelessness, can any business seem more fitted to heighten it than that\\nof continually handling these dead letters, and assorting them for the flames?\\nFor by the cart-load they are annually burned. Sometimes from out the folded\\npaper the pale clerk takes a ring—the finger it was meant for, perhaps,\\nmoulders in the grave; a bank-note sent in swiftest charity—he whom it\\nwould relieve, nor eats nor hungers any more; pardon for those who died\\ndespairing; hope for those who died unhoping; good tidings for those who died\\nstifled by unrelieved calamities. On errands of life, these letters speed to\\ndeath.', 'Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!', 'In the year 1799, Captain Amasa Delano, of Duxbury, in Massachusetts,\\ncommanding a large sealer and general trader, lay at anchor with a valuable\\ncargo, in the harbor of St. Maria—a small, desert, uninhabited island\\ntoward the southern extremity of the long coast of Chili. There he had touched\\nfor water.', 'On the second day, not long after dawn, while lying in his berth, his mate came\\nbelow, informing him that a strange sail was coming into the bay. Ships were\\nthen not so plenty in those waters as now. He rose, dressed, and went on deck.', 'The morning was one peculiar to that coast. Everything was mute and calm;\\neverything gray. The sea, though undulated into long roods of swells, seemed\\nfixed, and was sleeked at the surface like waved lead that has cooled and set\\nin the smelter’s mould. The sky seemed a gray surtout. Flights of\\ntroubled gray fowl, kith and kin with flights of troubled gray vapors among\\nwhich they were mixed, skimmed low and fitfully over the waters, as swallows\\nover meadows before storms. Shadows present, foreshadowing deeper shadows to\\ncome.', 'To Captain Delano’s surprise, the stranger, viewed through the glass,\\nshowed no colors; though to do so upon entering a haven, however uninhabited in\\nits shores, where but a single other ship might be lying, was the custom among\\npeaceful seamen of all nations. Considering the lawlessness and loneliness of\\nthe spot, and the sort of stories, at that day, associated with those seas,\\nCaptain Delano’s surprise might have deepened into some uneasiness had he\\nnot been a person of a singularly undistrustful good-nature, not liable, except\\non extraordinary and repeated incentives, and hardly then, to indulge in\\npersonal alarms, any way involving the imputation of malign evil in man.\\nWhether, in view of what humanity is capable, such a trait implies, along with\\na benevolent heart, more than ordinary quickness and accuracy of intellectual\\nperception, may be left to the wise to determine.', 'But whatever misgivings might have obtruded on first seeing the stranger, would\\nalmost, in any seaman’s mind, have been dissipated by observing that, the\\nship, in navigating into the harbor, was drawing too near the land; a sunken\\nreef making out off her bow. This seemed to prove her a stranger, indeed, not\\nonly to the sealer, but the island; consequently, she could be no wonted\\nfreebooter on that ocean. With no small interest, Captain Delano continued to\\nwatch her—a proceeding not much facilitated by the vapors partly mantling\\nthe hull, through which the far matin light from her cabin streamed equivocally\\nenough; much like the sun—by this time hemisphered on the rim of the\\nhorizon, and, apparently, in company with the strange ship entering the\\nharbor—which, wimpled by the same low, creeping clouds, showed not unlike\\na Lima intriguante’s one sinister eye peering across the Plaza from the\\nIndian loop-hole of her dusk saya-y-manta.', 'It might have been but a deception of the vapors, but, the longer the stranger\\nwas watched the more singular appeared her manoeuvres. Ere long it seemed hard\\nto decide whether she meant to come in or no—what she wanted, or what she\\nwas about. The wind, which had breezed up a little during the night, was now\\nextremely light and baffling, which the more increased the apparent uncertainty\\nof her movements. Surmising, at last, that it might be a ship in distress,\\nCaptain Delano ordered his whale-boat to be dropped, and, much to the wary\\nopposition of his mate, prepared to board her, and, at the least, pilot her in.\\nOn the night previous, a fishing-party of the seamen had gone a long distance\\nto some detached rocks out of sight from the sealer, and, an hour or two before\\ndaybreak, had returned, having met with no small success. Presuming that the\\nstranger might have been long off soundings, the good captain put several\\nbaskets of the fish, for presents, into his boat, and so pulled away. From her\\ncontinuing too near the sunken reef, deeming her in danger, calling to his men,\\nhe made all haste to apprise those on board of their situation. But, some time\\nere the boat came up, the wind, light though it was, having shifted, had headed\\nthe vessel off, as well as partly broken the vapors from about her.', 'Upon gaining a less remote view, the ship, when made signally visible on the\\nverge of the leaden-hued swells, with the shreds of fog here and there raggedly\\nfurring her, appeared like a white-washed monastery after a thunder-storm, seen\\nperched upon some dun cliff among the Pyrenees. But it was no purely fanciful\\nresemblance which now, for a moment, almost led Captain Delano to think that\\nnothing less than a ship-load of monks was before him. Peering over the\\nbulwarks were what really seemed, in the hazy distance, throngs of dark cowls;\\nwhile, fitfully revealed through the open port-holes, other dark moving figures\\nwere dimly descried, as of Black Friars pacing the cloisters.', 'Upon a still nigher approach, this appearance was modified, and the true\\ncharacter of the vessel was plain—a Spanish merchantman of the first\\nclass, carrying negro slaves, amongst other valuable freight, from one colonial\\nport to another. A very large, and, in its time, a very fine vessel, such as in\\nthose days were at intervals encountered along that main; sometimes superseded\\nAcapulco treasure-ships, or retired frigates of the Spanish king’s navy,\\nwhich, like superannuated Italian palaces, still, under a decline of masters,\\npreserved signs of former state.', 'As the whale-boat drew more and more nigh, the cause of the peculiar\\npipe-clayed aspect of the stranger was seen in the slovenly neglect pervading\\nher. The spars, ropes, and great part of the bulwarks, looked woolly, from long\\nunacquaintance with the scraper, tar, and the brush. Her keel seemed laid, her\\nribs put together, and she launched, from Ezekiel’s Valley of Dry Bones.', 'In the present business in which she was engaged, the ship’s general\\nmodel and rig appeared to have undergone no material change from their original\\nwarlike and Froissart pattern. However, no guns were seen.', 'The tops were large, and were railed about with what had once been octagonal\\nnet-work, all now in sad disrepair. These tops hung overhead like three ruinous\\naviaries, in one of which was seen, perched, on a ratlin, a white noddy, a\\nstrange fowl, so called from its lethargic, somnambulistic character, being\\nfrequently caught by hand at sea. Battered and mouldy, the castellated\\nforecastle seemed some ancient turret, long ago taken by assault, and then left\\nto decay. Toward the stern, two high-raised quarter galleries—the\\nbalustrades here and there covered with dry, tindery sea-moss—opening out\\nfrom the unoccupied state-cabin, whose dead-lights, for all the mild weather,\\nwere hermetically closed and calked—these tenantless balconies hung over\\nthe sea as if it were the grand Venetian canal. But the principal relic of\\nfaded grandeur was the ample oval of the shield-like stern-piece, intricately\\ncarved with the arms of Castile and Leon, medallioned about by groups of\\nmythological or symbolical devices; uppermost and central of which was a dark\\nsatyr in a mask, holding his foot on the prostrate neck of a writhing figure,\\nlikewise masked.', 'Whether the ship had a figure-head, or only a plain beak, was not quite\\ncertain, owing to canvas wrapped about that part, either to protect it while\\nundergoing a re-furbishing, or else decently to hide its decay. Rudely painted\\nor chalked, as in a sailor freak, along the forward side of a sort of pedestal\\nbelow the canvas, was the sentence, “Seguid vuestro jefe”\\n(follow your leader); while upon the tarnished headboards, near by, appeared,\\nin stately capitals, once gilt, the ship’s name, “SAN\\nDOMINICK,” each letter streakingly corroded with tricklings of\\ncopper-spike rust; while, like mourning weeds, dark festoons of sea-grass\\nslimily swept to and fro over the name, with every hearse-like roll of the\\nhull.', 'As, at last, the boat was hooked from the bow along toward the gangway\\namidship, its keel, while yet some inches separated from the hull, harshly\\ngrated as on a sunken coral reef. It proved a huge bunch of conglobated\\nbarnacles adhering below the water to the side like a wen—a token of\\nbaffling airs and long calms passed somewhere in those seas.', 'Climbing the side, the visitor was at once surrounded by a clamorous throng of\\nwhites and blacks, but the latter outnumbering the former more than could have\\nbeen expected, negro transportation-ship as the stranger in port was. But, in\\none language, and as with one voice, all poured out a common tale of suffering;\\nin which the negresses, of whom there were not a few, exceeded the others in\\ntheir dolorous vehemence. The scurvy, together with the fever, had swept off a\\ngreat part of their number, more especially the Spaniards. Off Cape Horn they\\nhad narrowly escaped shipwreck; then, for days together, they had lain tranced\\nwithout wind; their provisions were low; their water next to none; their lips\\nthat moment were baked.', 'While Captain Delano was thus made the mark of all eager tongues, his one eager\\nglance took in all faces, with every other object about him.', 'Always upon first boarding a large and populous ship at sea, especially a\\nforeign one, with a nondescript crew such as Lascars or Manilla men, the\\nimpression varies in a peculiar way from that produced by first entering a\\nstrange house with strange inmates in a strange land. Both house and\\nship—the one by its walls and blinds, the other by its high bulwarks like\\nramparts—hoard from view their interiors till the last moment: but in the\\ncase of the ship there is this addition; that the living spectacle it contains,\\nupon its sudden and complete disclosure, has, in contrast with the blank ocean\\nwhich zones it, something of the effect of enchantment. The ship seems unreal;\\nthese strange costumes, gestures, and faces, but a shadowy tableau just emerged\\nfrom the deep, which directly must receive back what it gave.', 'Perhaps it was some such influence, as above is attempted to be described,\\nwhich, in Captain Delano’s mind, heightened whatever, upon a staid\\nscrutiny, might have seemed unusual; especially the conspicuous figures of four\\nelderly grizzled negroes, their heads like black, doddered willow tops, who, in\\nvenerable contrast to the tumult below them, were couched, sphynx-like, one on\\nthe starboard cat-head, another on the larboard, and the remaining pair face to\\nface on the opposite bulwarks above the main-chains. They each had bits of\\nunstranded old junk in their hands, and, with a sort of stoical self-content,\\nwere picking the junk into oakum, a small heap of which lay by their sides.\\nThey accompanied the task with a continuous, low, monotonous, chant; droning\\nand drilling away like so many gray-headed bag-pipers playing a funeral march.', 'The quarter-deck rose into an ample elevated poop, upon the forward verge of\\nwhich, lifted, like the oakum-pickers, some eight feet above the general\\nthrong, sat along in a row, separated by regular spaces, the cross-legged\\nfigures of six other blacks; each with a rusty hatchet in his hand, which, with\\na bit of brick and a rag, he was engaged like a scullion in scouring; while\\nbetween each two was a small stack of hatchets, their rusted edges turned\\nforward awaiting a like operation. Though occasionally the four oakum-pickers\\nwould briefly address some person or persons in the crowd below, yet the six\\nhatchet-polishers neither spoke to others, nor breathed a whisper among\\nthemselves, but sat intent upon their task, except at intervals, when, with the\\npeculiar love in negroes of uniting industry with pastime, two and two they\\nsideways clashed their hatchets together, like cymbals, with a barbarous din.\\nAll six, unlike the generality, had the raw aspect of unsophisticated Africans.', 'But that first comprehensive glance which took in those ten figures, with\\nscores less conspicuous, rested but an instant upon them, as, impatient of the\\nhubbub of voices, the visitor turned in quest of whomsoever it might be that\\ncommanded the ship.', 'But as if not unwilling to let nature make known her own case among his\\nsuffering charge, or else in despair of restraining it for the time, the\\nSpanish captain, a gentlemanly, reserved-looking, and rather young man to a\\nstranger’s eye, dressed with singular richness, but bearing plain traces\\nof recent sleepless cares and disquietudes, stood passively by, leaning against\\nthe main-mast, at one moment casting a dreary, spiritless look upon his excited\\npeople, at the next an unhappy glance toward his visitor. By his side stood a\\nblack of small stature, in whose rude face, as occasionally, like a\\nshepherd’s dog, he mutely turned it up into the Spaniard’s, sorrow\\nand affection were equally blended.', 'Struggling through the throng, the American advanced to the Spaniard, assuring\\nhim of his sympathies, and offering to render whatever assistance might be in\\nhis power. To which the Spaniard returned for the present but grave and\\nceremonious acknowledgments, his national formality dusked by the saturnine\\nmood of ill-health.', 'But losing no time in mere compliments, Captain Delano, returning to the\\ngangway, had his basket of fish brought up; and as the wind still continued\\nlight, so that some hours at least must elapse ere the ship could be brought to\\nthe anchorage, he bade his men return to the sealer, and fetch back as much\\nwater as the whale-boat could carry, with whatever soft bread the steward might\\nhave, all the remaining pumpkins on board, with a box of sugar, and a dozen of\\nhis private bottles of cider.', 'Not many minutes after the boat’s pushing off, to the vexation of all,\\nthe wind entirely died away, and the tide turning, began drifting back the ship\\nhelplessly seaward. But trusting this would not long last, Captain Delano\\nsought, with good hopes, to cheer up the strangers, feeling no small\\nsatisfaction that, with persons in their condition, he could—thanks to\\nhis frequent voyages along the Spanish main—converse with some freedom in\\ntheir native tongue.', 'While left alone with them, he was not long in observing some things tending to\\nheighten his first impressions; but surprise was lost in pity, both for the\\nSpaniards and blacks, alike evidently reduced from scarcity of water and\\nprovisions; while long-continued suffering seemed to have brought out the less\\ngood-natured qualities of the negroes, besides, at the same time, impairing the\\nSpaniard’s authority over them. But, under the circumstances, precisely\\nthis condition of things was to have been anticipated. In armies, navies,\\ncities, or families, in nature herself, nothing more relaxes good order than\\nmisery. Still, Captain Delano was not without the idea, that had Benito Cereno\\nbeen a man of greater energy, misrule would hardly have come to the present\\npass. But the debility, constitutional or induced by hardships, bodily and\\nmental, of the Spanish captain, was too obvious to be overlooked. A prey to\\nsettled dejection, as if long mocked with hope he would not now indulge it,\\neven when it had ceased to be a mock, the prospect of that day, or evening at\\nfurthest, lying at anchor, with plenty of water for his people, and a brother\\ncaptain to counsel and befriend, seemed in no perceptible degree to encourage\\nhim. His mind appeared unstrung, if not still more seriously affected. Shut up\\nin these oaken walls, chained to one dull round of command, whose\\nunconditionality cloyed him, like some hypochondriac abbot he moved slowly\\nabout, at times suddenly pausing, starting, or staring, biting his lip, biting\\nhis finger-nail, flushing, paling, twitching his beard, with other symptoms of\\nan absent or moody mind. This distempered spirit was lodged, as before hinted,\\nin as distempered a frame. He was rather tall, but seemed never to have been\\nrobust, and now with nervous suffering was almost worn to a skeleton. A\\ntendency to some pulmonary complaint appeared to have been lately confirmed.\\nHis voice was like that of one with lungs half gone—hoarsely suppressed,\\na husky whisper. No wonder that, as in this state he tottered about, his\\nprivate servant apprehensively followed him. Sometimes the negro gave his\\nmaster his arm, or took his handkerchief out of his pocket for him; performing\\nthese and similar offices with that affectionate zeal which transmutes into\\nsomething filial or fraternal acts in themselves but menial; and which has\\ngained for the negro the repute of making the most pleasing body-servant in the\\nworld; one, too, whom a master need be on no stiffly superior terms with, but\\nmay treat with familiar trust; less a servant than a devoted companion.', 'Marking the noisy indocility of the blacks in general, as well as what seemed\\nthe sullen inefficiency of the whites it was not without humane satisfaction\\nthat Captain Delano witnessed the steady good conduct of Babo.', 'But the good conduct of Babo, hardly more than the ill-behavior of others,\\nseemed to withdraw the half-lunatic Don Benito from his cloudy languor. Not\\nthat such precisely was the impression made by the Spaniard on the mind of his\\nvisitor. The Spaniard’s individual unrest was, for the present, but noted\\nas a conspicuous feature in the ship’s general affliction. Still, Captain\\nDelano was not a little concerned at what he could not help taking for the time\\nto be Don Benito’s unfriendly indifference towards himself. The\\nSpaniard’s manner, too, conveyed a sort of sour and gloomy disdain, which\\nhe seemed at no pains to disguise. But this the American in charity ascribed to\\nthe harassing effects of sickness, since, in former instances, he had noted\\nthat there are peculiar natures on whom prolonged physical suffering seems to\\ncancel every social instinct of kindness; as if, forced to black bread\\nthemselves, they deemed it but equity that each person coming nigh them should,\\nindirectly, by some slight or affront, be made to partake of their fare.', 'But ere long Captain Delano bethought him that, indulgent as he was at the\\nfirst, in judging the Spaniard, he might not, after all, have exercised charity\\nenough. At bottom it was Don Benito’s reserve which displeased him; but\\nthe same reserve was shown towards all but his faithful personal attendant.\\nEven the formal reports which, according to sea-usage, were, at stated times,\\nmade to him by some petty underling, either a white, mulatto or black, he\\nhardly had patience enough to listen to, without betraying contemptuous\\naversion. His manner upon such occasions was, in its degree, not unlike that\\nwhich might be supposed to have been his imperial countryman’s, Charles\\nV., just previous to the anchoritish retirement of that monarch from the\\nthrone.', 'This splenetic disrelish of his place was evinced in almost every function\\npertaining to it. Proud as he was moody, he condescended to no personal\\nmandate. Whatever special orders were necessary, their delivery was delegated\\nto his body-servant, who in turn transferred them to their ultimate\\ndestination, through runners, alert Spanish boys or slave boys, like pages or\\npilot-fish within easy call continually hovering round Don Benito. So that to\\nhave beheld this undemonstrative invalid gliding about, apathetic and mute, no\\nlandsman could have dreamed that in him was lodged a dictatorship beyond which,\\nwhile at sea, there was no earthly appeal.', 'Thus, the Spaniard, regarded in his reserve, seemed the involuntary victim of\\nmental disorder. But, in fact, his reserve might, in some degree, have\\nproceeded from design. If so, then here was evinced the unhealthy climax of\\nthat icy though conscientious policy, more or less adopted by all commanders of\\nlarge ships, which, except in signal emergencies, obliterates alike the\\nmanifestation of sway with every trace of sociality; transforming the man into\\na block, or rather into a loaded cannon, which, until there is call for\\nthunder, has nothing to say.', 'Viewing him in this light, it seemed but a natural token of the perverse habit\\ninduced by a long course of such hard self-restraint, that, notwithstanding the\\npresent condition of his ship, the Spaniard should still persist in a demeanor,\\nwhich, however harmless, or, it may be, appropriate, in a well-appointed\\nvessel, such as the San Dominick might have been at the outset of the voyage,\\nwas anything but judicious now. But the Spaniard, perhaps, thought that it was\\nwith captains as with gods: reserve, under all events, must still be their cue.\\nBut probably this appearance of slumbering dominion might have been but an\\nattempted disguise to conscious imbecility—not deep policy, but shallow\\ndevice. But be all this as it might, whether Don Benito’s manner was\\ndesigned or not, the more Captain Delano noted its pervading reserve, the less\\nhe felt uneasiness at any particular manifestation of that reserve towards\\nhimself.', 'Neither were his thoughts taken up by the captain alone. Wonted to the quiet\\norderliness of the sealer’s comfortable family of a crew, the noisy\\nconfusion of the San Dominick’s suffering host repeatedly challenged his\\neye. Some prominent breaches, not only of discipline but of decency, were\\nobserved. These Captain Delano could not but ascribe, in the main, to the\\nabsence of those subordinate deck-officers to whom, along with higher duties,\\nis intrusted what may be styled the police department of a populous ship. True,\\nthe old oakum-pickers appeared at times to act the part of monitorial\\nconstables to their countrymen, the blacks; but though occasionally succeeding\\nin allaying trifling outbreaks now and then between man and man, they could do\\nlittle or nothing toward establishing general quiet. The San Dominick was in\\nthe condition of a transatlantic emigrant ship, among whose multitude of living\\nfreight are some individuals, doubtless, as little troublesome as crates and\\nbales; but the friendly remonstrances of such with their ruder companions are\\nof not so much avail as the unfriendly arm of the mate. What the San Dominick\\nwanted was, what the emigrant ship has, stern superior officers. But on these\\ndecks not so much as a fourth-mate was to be seen.', 'The visitor’s curiosity was roused to learn the particulars of those\\nmishaps which had brought about such absenteeism, with its consequences;\\nbecause, though deriving some inkling of the voyage from the wails which at the\\nfirst moment had greeted him, yet of the details no clear understanding had\\nbeen had. The best account would, doubtless, be given by the captain. Yet at\\nfirst the visitor was loth to ask it, unwilling to provoke some distant rebuff.\\nBut plucking up courage, he at last accosted Don Benito, renewing the\\nexpression of his benevolent interest, adding, that did he (Captain Delano) but\\nknow the particulars of the ship’s misfortunes, he would, perhaps, be\\nbetter able in the end to relieve them. Would Don Benito favor him with the\\nwhole story.', 'Don Benito faltered; then, like some somnambulist suddenly interfered with,\\nvacantly stared at his visitor, and ended by looking down on the deck. He\\nmaintained this posture so long, that Captain Delano, almost equally\\ndisconcerted, and involuntarily almost as rude, turned suddenly from him,\\nwalking forward to accost one of the Spanish seamen for the desired\\ninformation. But he had hardly gone five paces, when, with a sort of eagerness,\\nDon Benito invited him back, regretting his momentary absence of mind, and\\nprofessing readiness to gratify him.', 'While most part of the story was being given, the two captains stood on the\\nafter part of the main-deck, a privileged spot, no one being near but the\\nservant.', '“It is now a hundred and ninety days,” began the Spaniard, in his\\nhusky whisper, “that this ship, well officered and well manned, with\\nseveral cabin passengers—some fifty Spaniards in all—sailed from\\nBuenos Ayres bound to Lima, with a general cargo, hardware, Paraguay tea and\\nthe like—and,” pointing forward, “that parcel of negroes, now\\nnot more than a hundred and fifty, as you see, but then numbering over three\\nhundred souls. Off Cape Horn we had heavy gales. In one moment, by night, three\\nof my best officers, with fifteen sailors, were lost, with the main-yard; the\\nspar snapping under them in the slings, as they sought, with heavers, to beat\\ndown the icy sail. To lighten the hull, the heavier sacks of mata were thrown\\ninto the sea, with most of the water-pipes lashed on deck at the time. And this\\nlast necessity it was, combined with the prolonged detections afterwards\\nexperienced, which eventually brought about our chief causes of suffering.\\nWhen—”', 'Here there was a sudden fainting attack of his cough, brought on, no doubt, by\\nhis mental distress. His servant sustained him, and drawing a cordial from his\\npocket placed it to his lips. He a little revived. But unwilling to leave him\\nunsupported while yet imperfectly restored, the black with one arm still\\nencircled his master, at the same time keeping his eye fixed on his face, as if\\nto watch for the first sign of complete restoration, or relapse, as the event\\nmight prove.', 'The Spaniard proceeded, but brokenly and obscurely, as one in a dream.', '—“Oh, my God! rather than pass through what I have, with joy I\\nwould have hailed the most terrible gales; but—”', 'His cough returned and with increased violence; this subsiding; with reddened\\nlips and closed eyes he fell heavily against his supporter.', '“His mind wanders. He was thinking of the plague that followed the\\ngales,” plaintively sighed the servant; “my poor, poor\\nmaster!” wringing one hand, and with the other wiping the mouth.\\n“But be patient, Señor,” again turning to Captain Delano,\\n“these fits do not last long; master will soon be himself.”', 'Don Benito reviving, went on; but as this portion of the story was very\\nbrokenly delivered, the substance only will here be set down.', 'It appeared that after the ship had been many days tossed in storms off the\\nCape, the scurvy broke out, carrying off numbers of the whites and blacks. When\\nat last they had worked round into the Pacific, their spars and sails were so\\ndamaged, and so inadequately handled by the surviving mariners, most of whom\\nwere become invalids, that, unable to lay her northerly course by the wind,\\nwhich was powerful, the unmanageable ship, for successive days and nights, was\\nblown northwestward, where the breeze suddenly deserted her, in unknown waters,\\nto sultry calms. The absence of the water-pipes now proved as fatal to life as\\nbefore their presence had menaced it. Induced, or at least aggravated, by the\\nmore than scanty allowance of water, a malignant fever followed the scurvy;\\nwith the excessive heat of the lengthened calm, making such short work of it as\\nto sweep away, as by billows, whole families of the Africans, and a yet larger\\nnumber, proportionably, of the Spaniards, including, by a luckless fatality,\\nevery remaining officer on board. Consequently, in the smart west winds\\neventually following the calm, the already rent sails, having to be simply\\ndropped, not furled, at need, had been gradually reduced to the beggars’\\nrags they were now. To procure substitutes for his lost sailors, as well as\\nsupplies of water and sails, the captain, at the earliest opportunity, had made\\nfor Baldivia, the southernmost civilized port of Chili and South America; but\\nupon nearing the coast the thick weather had prevented him from so much as\\nsighting that harbor. Since which period, almost without a crew, and almost\\nwithout canvas and almost without water, and, at intervals giving its added\\ndead to the sea, the San Dominick had been battle-dored about by contrary\\nwinds, inveigled by currents, or grown weedy in calms. Like a man lost in\\nwoods, more than once she had doubled upon her own track.', '“But throughout these calamities,” huskily continued Don Benito,\\npainfully turning in the half embrace of his servant, “I have to thank\\nthose negroes you see, who, though to your inexperienced eyes appearing unruly,\\nhave, indeed, conducted themselves with less of restlessness than even their\\nowner could have thought possible under such circumstances.”', 'Here he again fell faintly back. Again his mind wandered; but he rallied, and\\nless obscurely proceeded.', '“Yes, their owner was quite right in assuring me that no fetters would be\\nneeded with his blacks; so that while, as is wont in this transportation, those\\nnegroes have always remained upon deck—not thrust below, as in the\\nGuinea-men—they have, also, from the beginning, been freely permitted to\\nrange within given bounds at their pleasure.”', 'Once more the faintness returned—his mind roved—but, recovering, he\\nresumed:', '“But it is Babo here to whom, under God, I owe not only my own\\npreservation, but likewise to him, chiefly, the merit is due, of pacifying his\\nmore ignorant brethren, when at intervals tempted to murmurings.”', '“Ah, master,” sighed the black, bowing his face, “don’t\\nspeak of me; Babo is nothing; what Babo has done was but duty.”', '“Faithful fellow!” cried Captain Delano. “Don Benito, I envy\\nyou such a friend; slave I cannot call him.”', 'As master and man stood before him, the black upholding the white, Captain\\nDelano could not but bethink him of the beauty of that relationship which could\\npresent such a spectacle of fidelity on the one hand and confidence on the\\nother. The scene was heightened by, the contrast in dress, denoting their\\nrelative positions. The Spaniard wore a loose Chili jacket of dark velvet;\\nwhite small-clothes and stockings, with silver buckles at the knee and instep;\\na high-crowned sombrero, of fine grass; a slender sword, silver mounted, hung\\nfrom a knot in his sash—the last being an almost invariable adjunct, more\\nfor utility than ornament, of a South American gentleman’s dress to this\\nhour. Excepting when his occasional nervous contortions brought about disarray,\\nthere was a certain precision in his attire curiously at variance with the\\nunsightly disorder around; especially in the belittered Ghetto, forward of the\\nmain-mast, wholly occupied by the blacks.', 'The servant wore nothing but wide trowsers, apparently, from their coarseness\\nand patches, made out of some old topsail; they were clean, and confined at the\\nwaist by a bit of unstranded rope, which, with his composed, deprecatory air at\\ntimes, made him look something like a begging friar of St. Francis.', 'However unsuitable for the time and place, at least in the blunt-thinking\\nAmerican’s eyes, and however strangely surviving in the midst of all his\\nafflictions, the toilette of Don Benito might not, in fashion at least, have\\ngone beyond the style of the day among South Americans of his class. Though on\\nthe present voyage sailing from Buenos Ayres, he had avowed himself a native\\nand resident of Chili, whose inhabitants had not so generally adopted the plain\\ncoat and once plebeian pantaloons; but, with a becoming modification, adhered\\nto their provincial costume, picturesque as any in the world. Still, relatively\\nto the pale history of the voyage, and his own pale face, there seemed\\nsomething so incongruous in the Spaniard’s apparel, as almost to suggest\\nthe image of an invalid courtier tottering about London streets in the time of\\nthe plague.', 'The portion of the narrative which, perhaps, most excited interest, as well as\\nsome surprise, considering the latitudes in question, was the long calms spoken\\nof, and more particularly the ship’s so long drifting about. Without\\ncommunicating the opinion, of course, the American could not but impute at\\nleast part of the detentions both to clumsy seamanship and faulty navigation.\\nEying Don Benito’s small, yellow hands, he easily inferred that the young\\ncaptain had not got into command at the hawse-hole, but the cabin-window; and\\nif so, why wonder at incompetence, in youth, sickness, and gentility united?', 'But drowning criticism in compassion, after a fresh repetition of his\\nsympathies, Captain Delano, having heard out his story, not only engaged, as in\\nthe first place, to see Don Benito and his people supplied in their immediate\\nbodily needs, but, also, now farther promised to assist him in procuring a\\nlarge permanent supply of water, as well as some sails and rigging; and, though\\nit would involve no small embarrassment to himself, yet he would spare three of\\nhis best seamen for temporary deck officers; so that without delay the ship\\nmight proceed to Conception, there fully to refit for Lima, her destined port.', 'Such generosity was not without its effect, even upon the invalid. His face\\nlighted up; eager and hectic, he met the honest glance of his visitor. With\\ngratitude he seemed overcome.', '“This excitement is bad for master,” whispered the servant, taking\\nhis arm, and with soothing words gently drawing him aside.', 'When Don Benito returned, the American was pained to observe that his\\nhopefulness, like the sudden kindling in his cheek, was but febrile and\\ntransient.', 'Ere long, with a joyless mien, looking up towards the poop, the host invited\\nhis guest to accompany him there, for the benefit of what little breath of wind\\nmight be stirring.', 'As, during the telling of the story, Captain Delano had once or twice started\\nat the occasional cymballing of the hatchet-polishers, wondering why such an\\ninterruption should be allowed, especially in that part of the ship, and in the\\nears of an invalid; and moreover, as the hatchets had anything but an\\nattractive look, and the handlers of them still less so, it was, therefore, to\\ntell the truth, not without some lurking reluctance, or even shrinking, it may\\nbe, that Captain Delano, with apparent complaisance, acquiesced in his\\nhost’s invitation. The more so, since, with an untimely caprice of\\npunctilio, rendered distressing by his cadaverous aspect, Don Benito, with\\nCastilian bows, solemnly insisted upon his guest’s preceding him up the\\nladder leading to the elevation; where, one on each side of the last step, sat\\nfor armorial supporters and sentries two of the ominous file. Gingerly enough\\nstepped good Captain Delano between them, and in the instant of leaving them\\nbehind, like one running the gauntlet, he felt an apprehensive twitch in the\\ncalves of his legs.', 'But when, facing about, he saw the whole file, like so many organ-grinders,\\nstill stupidly intent on their work, unmindful of everything beside, he could\\nnot but smile at his late fidgety panic.', 'Presently, while standing with his host, looking forward upon the decks below,\\nhe was struck by one of those instances of insubordination previously alluded\\nto. Three black boys, with two Spanish boys, were sitting together on the\\nhatches, scraping a rude wooden platter, in which some scanty mess had recently\\nbeen cooked. Suddenly, one of the black boys, enraged at a word dropped by one\\nof his white companions, seized a knife, and, though called to forbear by one\\nof the oakum-pickers, struck the lad over the head, inflicting a gash from\\nwhich blood flowed.', 'In amazement, Captain Delano inquired what this meant. To which the pale Don\\nBenito dully muttered, that it was merely the sport of the lad.', '“Pretty serious sport, truly,” rejoined Captain Delano. “Had\\nsuch a thing happened on board the Bachelor’s Delight, instant punishment\\nwould have followed.”', 'At these words the Spaniard turned upon the American one of his sudden,\\nstaring, half-lunatic looks; then, relapsing into his torpor, answered,\\n“Doubtless, doubtless, Señor.”', 'Is it, thought Captain Delano, that this hapless man is one of those paper\\ncaptains I’ve known, who by policy wink at what by power they cannot put\\ndown? I know no sadder sight than a commander who has little of command but the\\nname.', '“I should think, Don Benito,” he now said, glancing towards the\\noakum-picker who had sought to interfere with the boys, “that you would\\nfind it advantageous to keep all your blacks employed, especially the younger\\nones, no matter at what useless task, and no matter what happens to the ship.\\nWhy, even with my little band, I find such a course indispensable. I once kept\\na crew on my quarter-deck thrumming mats for my cabin, when, for three days, I\\nhad given up my ship—mats, men, and all—for a speedy loss, owing to\\nthe violence of a gale, in which we could do nothing but helplessly drive\\nbefore it.”', '“Doubtless, doubtless,” muttered Don Benito.', '“But,” continued Captain Delano, again glancing upon the\\noakum-pickers and then at the hatchet-polishers, near by, “I see you keep\\nsome, at least, of your host employed.”', '“Yes,” was again the vacant response.', '“Those old men there, shaking their pows from their pulpits,”\\ncontinued Captain Delano, pointing to the oakum-pickers, “seem to act the\\npart of old dominies to the rest, little heeded as their admonitions are at\\ntimes. Is this voluntary on their part, Don Benito, or have you appointed them\\nshepherds to your flock of black sheep?”', '“What posts they fill, I appointed them,” rejoined the Spaniard, in\\nan acrid tone, as if resenting some supposed satiric reflection.', '“And these others, these Ashantee conjurors here,” continued\\nCaptain Delano, rather uneasily eying the brandished steel of the\\nhatchet-polishers, where, in spots, it had been brought to a shine, “this\\nseems a curious business they are at, Don Benito?”', '“In the gales we met,” answered the Spaniard, “what of our\\ngeneral cargo was not thrown overboard was much damaged by the brine. Since\\ncoming into calm weather, I have had several cases of knives and hatchets daily\\nbrought up for overhauling and cleaning.”', '“A prudent idea, Don Benito. You are part owner of ship and cargo, I\\npresume; but none of the slaves, perhaps?”', '“I am owner of all you see,” impatiently returned Don Benito,\\n“except the main company of blacks, who belonged to my late friend,\\nAlexandro Aranda.”', 'As he mentioned this name, his air was heart-broken; his knees shook; his\\nservant supported him.', 'Thinking he divined the cause of such unusual emotion, to confirm his surmise,\\nCaptain Delano, after a pause, said: “And may I ask, Don Benito,\\nwhether—since awhile ago you spoke of some cabin passengers—the\\nfriend, whose loss so afflicts you, at the outset of the voyage accompanied his\\nblacks?”', '“Yes.”', '“But died of the fever?”', '“Died of the fever. Oh, could I but—”', 'Again quivering, the Spaniard paused.', '“Pardon me,” said Captain Delano, lowly, “but I think that,\\nby a sympathetic experience, I conjecture, Don Benito, what it is that gives\\nthe keener edge to your grief. It was once my hard fortune to lose, at sea, a\\ndear friend, my own brother, then supercargo. Assured of the welfare of his\\nspirit, its departure I could have borne like a man; but that honest eye, that\\nhonest hand—both of which had so often met mine—and that warm\\nheart; all, all—like scraps to the dogs—to throw all to the sharks!\\nIt was then I vowed never to have for fellow-voyager a man I loved, unless,\\nunbeknown to him, I had provided every requisite, in case of a fatality, for\\nembalming his mortal part for interment on shore. Were your friend’s\\nremains now on board this ship, Don Benito, not thus strangely would the\\nmention of his name affect you.”', '“On board this ship?” echoed the Spaniard. Then, with horrified\\ngestures, as directed against some spectre, he unconsciously fell into the\\nready arms of his attendant, who, with a silent appeal toward Captain Delano,\\nseemed beseeching him not again to broach a theme so unspeakably distressing to\\nhis master.', 'This poor fellow now, thought the pained American, is the victim of that sad\\nsuperstition which associates goblins with the deserted body of man, as ghosts\\nwith an abandoned house. How unlike are we made! What to me, in like case,\\nwould have been a solemn satisfaction, the bare suggestion, even, terrifies the\\nSpaniard into this trance. Poor Alexandro Aranda! what would you say could you\\nhere see your friend—who, on former voyages, when you, for months, were\\nleft behind, has, I dare say, often longed, and longed, for one peep at\\nyou—now transported with terror at the least thought of having you anyway\\nnigh him.', 'At this moment, with a dreary grave-yard toll, betokening a flaw, the\\nship’s forecastle bell, smote by one of the grizzled oakum-pickers,\\nproclaimed ten o’clock, through the leaden calm; when Captain\\nDelano’s attention was caught by the moving figure of a gigantic black,\\nemerging from the general crowd below, and slowly advancing towards the\\nelevated poop. An iron collar was about his neck, from which depended a chain,\\nthrice wound round his body; the terminating links padlocked together at a\\nbroad band of iron, his girdle.', '“How like a mute Atufal moves,” murmured the servant.', 'The black mounted the steps of the poop, and, like a brave prisoner, brought up\\nto receive sentence, stood in unquailing muteness before Don Benito, now\\nrecovered from his attack.', 'At the first glimpse of his approach, Don Benito had started, a resentful\\nshadow swept over his face; and, as with the sudden memory of bootless rage,\\nhis white lips glued together.', 'This is some mulish mutineer, thought Captain Delano, surveying, not without a\\nmixture of admiration, the colossal form of the negro.', '“See, he waits your question, master,” said the servant.', 'Thus reminded, Don Benito, nervously averting his glance, as if shunning, by\\nanticipation, some rebellious response, in a disconcerted voice, thus\\nspoke:—', '“Atufal, will you ask my pardon, now?”', 'The black was silent.', '“Again, master,” murmured the servant, with bitter upbraiding\\neyeing his countryman, “Again, master; he will bend to master yet.”', '“Answer,” said Don Benito, still averting his glance, “say\\nbut the one word, pardon, and your chains shall be off.”', 'Upon this, the black, slowly raising both arms, let them lifelessly fall, his\\nlinks clanking, his head bowed; as much as to say, “no, I am\\ncontent.”', '“Go,” said Don Benito, with inkept and unknown emotion.', 'Deliberately as he had come, the black obeyed.', '“Excuse me, Don Benito,” said Captain Delano, “but this scene\\nsurprises me; what means it, pray?”', '“It means that that negro alone, of all the band, has given me peculiar\\ncause of offense. I have put him in chains; I—”', 'Here he paused; his hand to his head, as if there were a swimming there, or a\\nsudden bewilderment of memory had come over him; but meeting his\\nservant’s kindly glance seemed reassured, and proceeded:—', '“I could not scourge such a form. But I told him he must ask my pardon.\\nAs yet he has not. At my command, every two hours he stands before me.”', '“And how long has this been?”', '“Some sixty days.”', '“And obedient in all else? And respectful?”', '“Yes.”', '“Upon my conscience, then,” exclaimed Captain Delano, impulsively,\\n“he has a royal spirit in him, this fellow.”', '“He may have some right to it,” bitterly returned Don Benito,\\n“he says he was king in his own land.”', '“Yes,” said the servant, entering a word, “those slits in\\nAtufal’s ears once held wedges of gold; but poor Babo here, in his own\\nland, was only a poor slave; a black man’s slave was Babo, who now is the\\nwhite’s.”', 'Somewhat annoyed by these conversational familiarities, Captain Delano turned\\ncuriously upon the attendant, then glanced inquiringly at his master; but, as\\nif long wonted to these little informalities, neither master nor man seemed to\\nunderstand him.', '“What, pray, was Atufal’s offense, Don Benito?” asked Captain\\nDelano; “if it was not something very serious, take a fool’s\\nadvice, and, in view of his general docility, as well as in some natural\\nrespect for his spirit, remit him his penalty.”', '“No, no, master never will do that,” here murmured the servant to\\nhimself, “proud Atufal must first ask master’s pardon. The slave\\nthere carries the padlock, but master here carries the key.”', 'His attention thus directed, Captain Delano now noticed for the first, that,\\nsuspended by a slender silken cord, from Don Benito’s neck, hung a key.\\nAt once, from the servant’s muttered syllables, divining the key’s\\npurpose, he smiled, and said:—“So, Don Benito—padlock and\\nkey—significant symbols, truly.”', 'Biting his lip, Don Benito faltered.', 'Though the remark of Captain Delano, a man of such native simplicity as to be\\nincapable of satire or irony, had been dropped in playful allusion to the\\nSpaniard’s singularly evidenced lordship over the black; yet the\\nhypochondriac seemed some way to have taken it as a malicious reflection upon\\nhis confessed inability thus far to break down, at least, on a verbal summons,\\nthe entrenched will of the slave. Deploring this supposed misconception, yet\\ndespairing of correcting it, Captain Delano shifted the subject; but finding\\nhis companion more than ever withdrawn, as if still sourly digesting the lees\\nof the presumed affront above-mentioned, by-and-by Captain Delano likewise\\nbecame less talkative, oppressed, against his own will, by what seemed the\\nsecret vindictiveness of the morbidly sensitive Spaniard. But the good sailor,\\nhimself of a quite contrary disposition, refrained, on his part, alike from the\\nappearance as from the feeling of resentment, and if silent, was only so from\\ncontagion.', 'Presently the Spaniard, assisted by his servant somewhat discourteously crossed\\nover from his guest; a procedure which, sensibly enough, might have been\\nallowed to pass for idle caprice of ill-humor, had not master and man,\\nlingering round the corner of the elevated skylight, began whispering together\\nin low voices. This was unpleasing. And more; the moody air of the Spaniard,\\nwhich at times had not been without a sort of valetudinarian stateliness, now\\nseemed anything but dignified; while the menial familiarity of the servant lost\\nits original charm of simple-hearted attachment.', 'In his embarrassment, the visitor turned his face to the other side of the\\nship. By so doing, his glance accidentally fell on a young Spanish sailor, a\\ncoil of rope in his hand, just stepped from the deck to the first round of the\\nmizzen-rigging. Perhaps the man would not have been particularly noticed, were\\nit not that, during his ascent to one of the yards, he, with a sort of covert\\nintentness, kept his eye fixed on Captain Delano, from whom, presently, it\\npassed, as if by a natural sequence, to the two whisperers.', 'His own attention thus redirected to that quarter, Captain Delano gave a slight\\nstart. From something in Don Benito’s manner just then, it seemed as if\\nthe visitor had, at least partly, been the subject of the withdrawn\\nconsultation going on—a conjecture as little agreeable to the guest as it\\nwas little flattering to the host.', 'The singular alternations of courtesy and ill-breeding in the Spanish captain\\nwere unaccountable, except on one of two suppositions—innocent lunacy, or\\nwicked imposture.', 'But the first idea, though it might naturally have occurred to an indifferent\\nobserver, and, in some respect, had not hitherto been wholly a stranger to\\nCaptain Delano’s mind, yet, now that, in an incipient way, he began to\\nregard the stranger’s conduct something in the light of an intentional\\naffront, of course the idea of lunacy was virtually vacated. But if not a\\nlunatic, what then? Under the circumstances, would a gentleman, nay, any honest\\nboor, act the part now acted by his host? The man was an impostor. Some\\nlow-born adventurer, masquerading as an oceanic grandee; yet so ignorant of the\\nfirst requisites of mere gentlemanhood as to be betrayed into the present\\nremarkable indecorum. That strange ceremoniousness, too, at other times\\nevinced, seemed not uncharacteristic of one playing a part above his real\\nlevel. Benito Cereno—Don Benito Cereno—a sounding name. One, too,\\nat that period, not unknown, in the surname, to super-cargoes and sea captains\\ntrading along the Spanish Main, as belonging to one of the most enterprising\\nand extensive mercantile families in all those provinces; several members of it\\nhaving titles; a sort of Castilian Rothschild, with a noble brother, or cousin,\\nin every great trading town of South America. The alleged Don Benito was in\\nearly manhood, about twenty-nine or thirty. To assume a sort of roving\\ncadetship in the maritime affairs of such a house, what more likely scheme for\\na young knave of talent and spirit? But the Spaniard was a pale invalid. Never\\nmind. For even to the degree of simulating mortal disease, the craft of some\\ntricksters had been known to attain. To think that, under the aspect of\\ninfantile weakness, the most savage energies might be couched—those\\nvelvets of the Spaniard but the silky paw to his fangs.', 'From no train of thought did these fancies come; not from within, but from\\nwithout; suddenly, too, and in one throng, like hoar frost; yet as soon to\\nvanish as the mild sun of Captain Delano’s good-nature regained its\\nmeridian.', 'Glancing over once more towards his host—whose side-face, revealed above\\nthe skylight, was now turned towards him—he was struck by the profile,\\nwhose clearness of cut was refined by the thinness, incident to ill-health, as\\nwell as ennobled about the chin by the beard. Away with suspicion. He was a\\ntrue off-shoot of a true hidalgo Cereno.', 'Relieved by these and other better thoughts, the visitor, lightly humming a\\ntune, now began indifferently pacing the poop, so as not to betray to Don\\nBenito that he had at all mistrusted incivility, much less duplicity; for such\\nmistrust would yet be proved illusory, and by the event; though, for the\\npresent, the circumstance which had provoked that distrust remained\\nunexplained. But when that little mystery should have been cleared up, Captain\\nDelano thought he might extremely regret it, did he allow Don Benito to become\\naware that he had indulged in ungenerous surmises. In short, to the\\nSpaniard’s black-letter text, it was best, for awhile, to leave open\\nmargin.', 'Presently, his pale face twitching and overcast, the Spaniard, still supported\\nby his attendant, moved over towards his guest, when, with even more than his\\nusual embarrassment, and a strange sort of intriguing intonation in his husky\\nwhisper, the following conversation began:—', '“Señor, may I ask how long you have lain at this isle?”', '“Oh, but a day or two, Don Benito.”', '“And from what port are you last?”', '“Canton.”', '“And there, Señor, you exchanged your sealskins for teas and silks, I\\nthink you said?”', '“Yes, Silks, mostly.”', '“And the balance you took in specie, perhaps?”', 'Captain Delano, fidgeting a little, answered—', '“Yes; some silver; not a very great deal, though.”', '“Ah—well. May I ask how many men have you, Señor?”', 'Captain Delano slightly started, but answered—', '“About five-and-twenty, all told.”', '“And at present, Señor, all on board, I suppose?”', '“All on board, Don Benito,” replied the Captain, now with\\nsatisfaction.', '“And will be to-night, Señor?”', 'At this last question, following so many pertinacious ones, for the soul of him\\nCaptain Delano could not but look very earnestly at the questioner, who,\\ninstead of meeting the glance, with every token of craven discomposure dropped\\nhis eyes to the deck; presenting an unworthy contrast to his servant, who, just\\nthen, was kneeling at his feet, adjusting a loose shoe-buckle; his disengaged\\nface meantime, with humble curiosity, turned openly up into his master’s\\ndowncast one.', 'The Spaniard, still with a guilty shuffle, repeated his question:', '“And—and will be to-night, Señor?”', '“Yes, for aught I know,” returned Captain Delano—“but\\nnay,” rallying himself into fearless truth, “some of them talked of\\ngoing off on another fishing party about midnight.”', '“Your ships generally go—go more or less armed, I believe,\\nSeñor?”', '“Oh, a six-pounder or two, in case of emergency,” was the\\nintrepidly indifferent reply, “with a small stock of muskets,\\nsealing-spears, and cutlasses, you know.”', 'As he thus responded, Captain Delano again glanced at Don Benito, but the\\nlatter’s eyes were averted; while abruptly and awkwardly shifting the\\nsubject, he made some peevish allusion to the calm, and then, without apology,\\nonce more, with his attendant, withdrew to the opposite bulwarks, where the\\nwhispering was resumed.', 'At this moment, and ere Captain Delano could cast a cool thought upon what had\\njust passed, the young Spanish sailor, before mentioned, was seen descending\\nfrom the rigging. In act of stooping over to spring inboard to the deck, his\\nvoluminous, unconfined frock, or shirt, of coarse woolen, much spotted with\\ntar, opened out far down the chest, revealing a soiled under garment of what\\nseemed the finest linen, edged, about the neck, with a narrow blue ribbon,\\nsadly faded and worn. At this moment the young sailor’s eye was again\\nfixed on the whisperers, and Captain Delano thought he observed a lurking\\nsignificance in it, as if silent signs, of some Freemason sort, had that\\ninstant been interchanged.', 'This once more impelled his own glance in the direction of Don Benito, and, as\\nbefore, he could not but infer that himself formed the subject of the\\nconference. He paused. The sound of the hatchet-polishing fell on his ears. He\\ncast another swift side-look at the two. They had the air of conspirators. In\\nconnection with the late questionings, and the incident of the young sailor,\\nthese things now begat such return of involuntary suspicion, that the singular\\nguilelessness of the American could not endure it. Plucking up a gay and\\nhumorous expression, he crossed over to the two rapidly,\\nsaying:—“Ha, Don Benito, your black here seems high in your trust;\\na sort of privy-counselor, in fact.”', 'Upon this, the servant looked up with a good-natured grin, but the master\\nstarted as from a venomous bite. It was a moment or two before the Spaniard\\nsufficiently recovered himself to reply; which he did, at last, with cold\\nconstraint:—“Yes, Señor, I have trust in Babo.”', 'Here Babo, changing his previous grin of mere animal humor into an intelligent\\nsmile, not ungratefully eyed his master.', 'Finding that the Spaniard now stood silent and reserved, as if involuntarily,\\nor purposely giving hint that his guest’s proximity was inconvenient just\\nthen, Captain Delano, unwilling to appear uncivil even to incivility itself,\\nmade some trivial remark and moved off; again and again turning over in his\\nmind the mysterious demeanor of Don Benito Cereno.', 'He had descended from the poop, and, wrapped in thought, was passing near a\\ndark hatchway, leading down into the steerage, when, perceiving motion there,\\nhe looked to see what moved. The same instant there was a sparkle in the\\nshadowy hatchway, and he saw one of the Spanish sailors, prowling there\\nhurriedly placing his hand in the bosom of his frock, as if hiding something.\\nBefore the man could have been certain who it was that was passing, he slunk\\nbelow out of sight. But enough was seen of him to make it sure that he was the\\nsame young sailor before noticed in the rigging.', 'What was that which so sparkled? thought Captain Delano. It was no\\nlamp—no match—no live coal. Could it have been a jewel? But how\\ncome sailors with jewels?—or with silk-trimmed under-shirts either? Has\\nhe been robbing the trunks of the dead cabin-passengers? But if so, he would\\nhardly wear one of the stolen articles on board ship here. Ah, ah—if,\\nnow, that was, indeed, a secret sign I saw passing between this suspicious\\nfellow and his captain awhile since; if I could only be certain that, in my\\nuneasiness, my senses did not deceive me, then—', 'Here, passing from one suspicious thing to another, his mind revolved the\\nstrange questions put to him concerning his ship.', 'By a curious coincidence, as each point was recalled, the black wizards of\\nAshantee would strike up with their hatchets, as in ominous comment on the\\nwhite stranger’s thoughts. Pressed by such enigmas and portents, it would\\nhave been almost against nature, had not, even into the least distrustful\\nheart, some ugly misgivings obtruded.', 'Observing the ship, now helplessly fallen into a current, with enchanted sails,\\ndrifting with increased rapidity seaward; and noting that, from a lately\\nintercepted projection of the land, the sealer was hidden, the stout mariner\\nbegan to quake at thoughts which he barely durst confess to himself. Above all,\\nhe began to feel a ghostly dread of Don Benito. And yet, when he roused\\nhimself, dilated his chest, felt himself strong on his legs, and coolly\\nconsidered it—what did all these phantoms amount to?', 'Had the Spaniard any sinister scheme, it must have reference not so much to him\\n(Captain Delano) as to his ship (the Bachelor’s Delight). Hence the\\npresent drifting away of the one ship from the other, instead of favoring any\\nsuch possible scheme, was, for the time, at least, opposed to it. Clearly any\\nsuspicion, combining such contradictions, must need be delusive. Beside, was it\\nnot absurd to think of a vessel in distress—a vessel by sickness almost\\ndismanned of her crew—a vessel whose inmates were parched for\\nwater—was it not a thousand times absurd that such a craft should, at\\npresent, be of a piratical character; or her commander, either for himself or\\nthose under him, cherish any desire but for speedy relief and refreshment? But\\nthen, might not general distress, and thirst in particular, be affected? And\\nmight not that same undiminished Spanish crew, alleged to have perished off to\\na remnant, be at that very moment lurking in the hold? On heart-broken pretense\\nof entreating a cup of cold water, fiends in human form had got into lonely\\ndwellings, nor retired until a dark deed had been done. And among the Malay\\npirates, it was no unusual thing to lure ships after them into their\\ntreacherous harbors, or entice boarders from a declared enemy at sea, by the\\nspectacle of thinly manned or vacant decks, beneath which prowled a hundred\\nspears with yellow arms ready to upthrust them through the mats. Not that\\nCaptain Delano had entirely credited such things. He had heard of\\nthem—and now, as stories, they recurred. The present destination of the\\nship was the anchorage. There she would be near his own vessel. Upon gaining\\nthat vicinity, might not the San Dominick, like a slumbering volcano, suddenly\\nlet loose energies now hid?', 'He recalled the Spaniard’s manner while telling his story. There was a\\ngloomy hesitancy and subterfuge about it. It was just the manner of one making\\nup his tale for evil purposes, as he goes. But if that story was not true, what\\nwas the truth? That the ship had unlawfully come into the Spaniard’s\\npossession? But in many of its details, especially in reference to the more\\ncalamitous parts, such as the fatalities among the seamen, the consequent\\nprolonged beating about, the past sufferings from obstinate calms, and still\\ncontinued suffering from thirst; in all these points, as well as others, Don\\nBenito’s story had corroborated not only the wailing ejaculations of the\\nindiscriminate multitude, white and black, but likewise—what seemed\\nimpossible to be counterfeit—by the very expression and play of every\\nhuman feature, which Captain Delano saw. If Don Benito’s story was,\\nthroughout, an invention, then every soul on board, down to the youngest\\nnegress, was his carefully drilled recruit in the plot: an incredible\\ninference. And yet, if there was ground for mistrusting his veracity, that\\ninference was a legitimate one.', 'But those questions of the Spaniard. There, indeed, one might pause. Did they\\nnot seem put with much the same object with which the burglar or assassin, by\\nday-time, reconnoitres the walls of a house? But, with ill purposes, to solicit\\nsuch information openly of the chief person endangered, and so, in effect,\\nsetting him on his guard; how unlikely a procedure was that? Absurd, then, to\\nsuppose that those questions had been prompted by evil designs. Thus, the same\\nconduct, which, in this instance, had raised the alarm, served to dispel it. In\\nshort, scarce any suspicion or uneasiness, however apparently reasonable at the\\ntime, which was not now, with equal apparent reason, dismissed.', 'At last he began to laugh at his former forebodings; and laugh at the strange\\nship for, in its aspect, someway siding with them, as it were; and laugh, too,\\nat the odd-looking blacks, particularly those old scissors-grinders, the\\nAshantees; and those bed-ridden old knitting women, the oakum-pickers; and\\nalmost at the dark Spaniard himself, the central hobgoblin of all.', 'For the rest, whatever in a serious way seemed enigmatical, was now\\ngood-naturedly explained away by the thought that, for the most part, the poor\\ninvalid scarcely knew what he was about; either sulking in black vapors, or\\nputting idle questions without sense or object. Evidently for the present, the\\nman was not fit to be intrusted with the ship. On some benevolent plea\\nwithdrawing the command from him, Captain Delano would yet have to send her to\\nConception, in charge of his second mate, a worthy person and good\\nnavigator—a plan not more convenient for the San Dominick than for Don\\nBenito; for, relieved from all anxiety, keeping wholly to his cabin, the sick\\nman, under the good nursing of his servant, would, probably, by the end of the\\npassage, be in a measure restored to health, and with that he should also be\\nrestored to authority.', 'Such were the American’s thoughts. They were tranquilizing. There was a\\ndifference between the idea of Don Benito’s darkly pre-ordaining Captain\\nDelano’s fate, and Captain Delano’s lightly arranging Don\\nBenito’s. Nevertheless, it was not without something of relief that the\\ngood seaman presently perceived his whale-boat in the distance. Its absence had\\nbeen prolonged by unexpected detention at the sealer’s side, as well as\\nits returning trip lengthened by the continual recession of the goal.', 'The advancing speck was observed by the blacks. Their shouts attracted the\\nattention of Don Benito, who, with a return of courtesy, approaching Captain\\nDelano, expressed satisfaction at the coming of some supplies, slight and\\ntemporary as they must necessarily prove.', 'Captain Delano responded; but while doing so, his attention was drawn to\\nsomething passing on the deck below: among the crowd climbing the landward\\nbulwarks, anxiously watching the coming boat, two blacks, to all appearances\\naccidentally incommoded by one of the sailors, violently pushed him aside,\\nwhich the sailor someway resenting, they dashed him to the deck, despite the\\nearnest cries of the oakum-pickers.', '“Don Benito,” said Captain Delano quickly, “do you see what\\nis going on there? Look!”', 'But, seized by his cough, the Spaniard staggered, with both hands to his face,\\non the point of falling. Captain Delano would have supported him, but the\\nservant was more alert, who, with one hand sustaining his master, with the\\nother applied the cordial. Don Benito restored, the black withdrew his support,\\nslipping aside a little, but dutifully remaining within call of a whisper. Such\\ndiscretion was here evinced as quite wiped away, in the visitor’s eyes,\\nany blemish of impropriety which might have attached to the attendant, from the\\nindecorous conferences before mentioned; showing, too, that if the servant were\\nto blame, it might be more the master’s fault than his own, since, when\\nleft to himself, he could conduct thus well.', 'His glance called away from the spectacle of disorder to the more pleasing one\\nbefore him, Captain Delano could not avoid again congratulating his host upon\\npossessing such a servant, who, though perhaps a little too forward now and\\nthen, must upon the whole be invaluable to one in the invalid’s\\nsituation.', '“Tell me, Don Benito,” he added, with a smile—“I should\\nlike to have your man here, myself—what will you take for him? Would\\nfifty doubloons be any object?”', '“Master wouldn’t part with Babo for a thousand doubloons,”\\nmurmured the black, overhearing the offer, and taking it in earnest, and, with\\nthe strange vanity of a faithful slave, appreciated by his master, scorning to\\nhear so paltry a valuation put upon him by a stranger. But Don Benito,\\napparently hardly yet completely restored, and again interrupted by his cough,\\nmade but some broken reply.', 'Soon his physical distress became so great, affecting his mind, too,\\napparently, that, as if to screen the sad spectacle, the servant gently\\nconducted his master below.', 'Left to himself, the American, to while away the time till his boat should\\narrive, would have pleasantly accosted some one of the few Spanish seamen he\\nsaw; but recalling something that Don Benito had said touching their ill\\nconduct, he refrained; as a shipmaster indisposed to countenance cowardice or\\nunfaithfulness in seamen.', 'While, with these thoughts, standing with eye directed forward towards that\\nhandful of sailors, suddenly he thought that one or two of them returned the\\nglance and with a sort of meaning. He rubbed his eyes, and looked again; but\\nagain seemed to see the same thing. Under a new form, but more obscure than any\\nprevious one, the old suspicions recurred, but, in the absence of Don Benito,\\nwith less of panic than before. Despite the bad account given of the sailors,\\nCaptain Delano resolved forthwith to accost one of them. Descending the poop,\\nhe made his way through the blacks, his movement drawing a queer cry from the\\noakum-pickers, prompted by whom, the negroes, twitching each other aside,\\ndivided before him; but, as if curious to see what was the object of this\\ndeliberate visit to their Ghetto, closing in behind, in tolerable order,\\nfollowed the white stranger up. His progress thus proclaimed as by mounted\\nkings-at-arms, and escorted as by a Caffre guard of honor, Captain Delano,\\nassuming a good-humored, off-handed air, continued to advance; now and then\\nsaying a blithe word to the negroes, and his eye curiously surveying the white\\nfaces, here and there sparsely mixed in with the blacks, like stray white pawns\\nventurously involved in the ranks of the chess-men opposed.', 'While thinking which of them to select for his purpose, he chanced to observe a\\nsailor seated on the deck engaged in tarring the strap of a large block, a\\ncircle of blacks squatted round him inquisitively eying the process.', 'The mean employment of the man was in contrast with something superior in his\\nfigure. His hand, black with continually thrusting it into the tar-pot held for\\nhim by a negro, seemed not naturally allied to his face, a face which would\\nhave been a very fine one but for its haggardness. Whether this haggardness had\\naught to do with criminality, could not be determined; since, as intense heat\\nand cold, though unlike, produce like sensations, so innocence and guilt, when,\\nthrough casual association with mental pain, stamping any visible impress, use\\none seal—a hacked one.', 'Not again that this reflection occurred to Captain Delano at the time,\\ncharitable man as he was. Rather another idea. Because observing so singular a\\nhaggardness combined with a dark eye, averted as in trouble and shame, and then\\nagain recalling Don Benito’s confessed ill opinion of his crew,\\ninsensibly he was operated upon by certain general notions which, while\\ndisconnecting pain and abashment from virtue, invariably link them with vice.', 'If, indeed, there be any wickedness on board this ship, thought Captain Delano,\\nbe sure that man there has fouled his hand in it, even as now he fouls it in\\nthe pitch. I don’t like to accost him. I will speak to this other, this\\nold Jack here on the windlass.', 'He advanced to an old Barcelona tar, in ragged red breeches and dirty\\nnight-cap, cheeks trenched and bronzed, whiskers dense as thorn hedges. Seated\\nbetween two sleepy-looking Africans, this mariner, like his younger shipmate,\\nwas employed upon some rigging—splicing a cable—the sleepy-looking\\nblacks performing the inferior function of holding the outer parts of the ropes\\nfor him.', 'Upon Captain Delano’s approach, the man at once hung his head below its\\nprevious level; the one necessary for business. It appeared as if he desired to\\nbe thought absorbed, with more than common fidelity, in his task. Being\\naddressed, he glanced up, but with what seemed a furtive, diffident air, which\\nsat strangely enough on his weather-beaten visage, much as if a grizzly bear,\\ninstead of growling and biting, should simper and cast sheep’s eyes. He\\nwas asked several questions concerning the voyage—questions purposely\\nreferring to several particulars in Don Benito’s narrative, not\\npreviously corroborated by those impulsive cries greeting the visitor on first\\ncoming on board. The questions were briefly answered, confirming all that\\nremained to be confirmed of the story. The negroes about the windlass joined in\\nwith the old sailor; but, as they became talkative, he by degrees became mute,\\nand at length quite glum, seemed morosely unwilling to answer more questions,\\nand yet, all the while, this ursine air was somehow mixed with his sheepish\\none.', 'Despairing of getting into unembarrassed talk with such a centaur, Captain\\nDelano, after glancing round for a more promising countenance, but seeing none,\\nspoke pleasantly to the blacks to make way for him; and so, amid various grins\\nand grimaces, returned to the poop, feeling a little strange at first, he could\\nhardly tell why, but upon the whole with regained confidence in Benito Cereno.', 'How plainly, thought he, did that old whiskerando yonder betray a consciousness\\nof ill desert. No doubt, when he saw me coming, he dreaded lest I, apprised by\\nhis Captain of the crew’s general misbehavior, came with sharp words for\\nhim, and so down with his head. And yet—and yet, now that I think of it,\\nthat very old fellow, if I err not, was one of those who seemed so earnestly\\neying me here awhile since. Ah, these currents spin one’s head round\\nalmost as much as they do the ship. Ha, there now’s a pleasant sort of\\nsunny sight; quite sociable, too.', 'His attention had been drawn to a slumbering negress, partly disclosed through\\nthe lacework of some rigging, lying, with youthful limbs carelessly disposed,\\nunder the lee of the bulwarks, like a doe in the shade of a woodland rock.\\nSprawling at her lapped breasts, was her wide-awake fawn, stark naked, its\\nblack little body half lifted from the deck, crosswise with its dam’s;\\nits hands, like two paws, clambering upon her; its mouth and nose ineffectually\\nrooting to get at the mark; and meantime giving a vexatious half-grunt,\\nblending with the composed snore of the negress.', 'The uncommon vigor of the child at length roused the mother. She started up, at\\na distance facing Captain Delano. But as if not at all concerned at the\\nattitude in which she had been caught, delightedly she caught the child up,\\nwith maternal transports, covering it with kisses.', 'There’s naked nature, now; pure tenderness and love, thought Captain\\nDelano, well pleased.', 'This incident prompted him to remark the other negresses more particularly than\\nbefore. He was gratified with their manners: like most uncivilized women, they\\nseemed at once tender of heart and tough of constitution; equally ready to die\\nfor their infants or fight for them. Unsophisticated as leopardesses; loving as\\ndoves. Ah! thought Captain Delano, these, perhaps, are some of the very women\\nwhom Ledyard saw in Africa, and gave such a noble account of.', 'These natural sights somehow insensibly deepened his confidence and ease. At\\nlast he looked to see how his boat was getting on; but it was still pretty\\nremote. He turned to see if Don Benito had returned; but he had not.', 'To change the scene, as well as to please himself with a leisurely observation\\nof the coming boat, stepping over into the mizzen-chains, he clambered his way\\ninto the starboard quarter-gallery—one of those abandoned\\nVenetian-looking water-balconies previously mentioned—retreats cut off\\nfrom the deck. As his foot pressed the half-damp, half-dry sea-mosses matting\\nthe place, and a chance phantom cats-paw—an islet of breeze, unheralded,\\nunfollowed—as this ghostly cats-paw came fanning his cheek; as his glance\\nfell upon the row of small, round dead-lights—all closed like coppered\\neyes of the coffined—and the state-cabin door, once connecting with the\\ngallery, even as the dead-lights had once looked out upon it, but now calked\\nfast like a sarcophagus lid; and to a purple-black tarred-over, panel,\\nthreshold, and post; and he bethought him of the time, when that state-cabin\\nand this state-balcony had heard the voices of the Spanish king’s\\nofficers, and the forms of the Lima viceroy’s daughters had perhaps\\nleaned where he stood—as these and other images flitted through his mind,\\nas the cats-paw through the calm, gradually he felt rising a dreamy inquietude,\\nlike that of one who alone on the prairie feels unrest from the repose of the\\nnoon.', 'He leaned against the carved balustrade, again looking off toward his boat; but\\nfound his eye falling upon the ribbon grass, trailing along the ship’s\\nwater-line, straight as a border of green box; and parterres of sea-weed, broad\\novals and crescents, floating nigh and far, with what seemed long formal alleys\\nbetween, crossing the terraces of swells, and sweeping round as if leading to\\nthe grottoes below. And overhanging all was the balustrade by his arm, which,\\npartly stained with pitch and partly embossed with moss, seemed the charred\\nruin of some summer-house in a grand garden long running to waste.', 'Trying to break one charm, he was but becharmed anew. Though upon the wide sea,\\nhe seemed in some far inland country; prisoner in some deserted château, left\\nto stare at empty grounds, and peer out at vague roads, where never wagon or\\nwayfarer passed.', 'But these enchantments were a little disenchanted as his eye fell on the\\ncorroded main-chains. Of an ancient style, massy and rusty in link, shackle and\\nbolt, they seemed even more fit for the ship’s present business than the\\none for which she had been built.', 'Presently he thought something moved nigh the chains. He rubbed his eyes, and\\nlooked hard. Groves of rigging were about the chains; and there, peering from\\nbehind a great stay, like an Indian from behind a hemlock, a Spanish sailor, a\\nmarlingspike in his hand, was seen, who made what seemed an imperfect gesture\\ntowards the balcony, but immediately as if alarmed by some advancing step along\\nthe deck within, vanished into the recesses of the hempen forest, like a\\npoacher.', 'What meant this? Something the man had sought to communicate, unbeknown to any\\none, even to his captain. Did the secret involve aught unfavorable to his\\ncaptain? Were those previous misgivings of Captain Delano’s about to be\\nverified? Or, in his haunted mood at the moment, had some random, unintentional\\nmotion of the man, while busy with the stay, as if repairing it, been mistaken\\nfor a significant beckoning?', 'Not unbewildered, again he gazed off for his boat. But it was temporarily\\nhidden by a rocky spur of the isle. As with some eagerness he bent forward,\\nwatching for the first shooting view of its beak, the balustrade gave way\\nbefore him like charcoal. Had he not clutched an outreaching rope he would have\\nfallen into the sea. The crash, though feeble, and the fall, though hollow, of\\nthe rotten fragments, must have been overheard. He glanced up. With sober\\ncuriosity peering down upon him was one of the old oakum-pickers, slipped from\\nhis perch to an outside boom; while below the old negro, and, invisible to him,\\nreconnoitering from a port-hole like a fox from the mouth of its den, crouched\\nthe Spanish sailor again. From something suddenly suggested by the man’s\\nair, the mad idea now darted into Captain Delano’s mind, that Don\\nBenito’s plea of indisposition, in withdrawing below, was but a pretense:\\nthat he was engaged there maturing his plot, of which the sailor, by some means\\ngaining an inkling, had a mind to warn the stranger against; incited, it may\\nbe, by gratitude for a kind word on first boarding the ship. Was it from\\nforeseeing some possible interference like this, that Don Benito had,\\nbeforehand, given such a bad character of his sailors, while praising the\\nnegroes; though, indeed, the former seemed as docile as the latter the\\ncontrary? The whites, too, by nature, were the shrewder race. A man with some\\nevil design, would he not be likely to speak well of that stupidity which was\\nblind to his depravity, and malign that intelligence from which it might not be\\nhidden? Not unlikely, perhaps. But if the whites had dark secrets concerning\\nDon Benito, could then Don Benito be any way in complicity with the blacks? But\\nthey were too stupid. Besides, who ever heard of a white so far a renegade as\\nto apostatize from his very species almost, by leaguing in against it with\\nnegroes? These difficulties recalled former ones. Lost in their mazes, Captain\\nDelano, who had now regained the deck, was uneasily advancing along it, when he\\nobserved a new face; an aged sailor seated cross-legged near the main hatchway.\\nHis skin was shrunk up with wrinkles like a pelican’s empty pouch; his\\nhair frosted; his countenance grave and composed. His hands were full of ropes,\\nwhich he was working into a large knot. Some blacks were about him obligingly\\ndipping the strands for him, here and there, as the exigencies of the operation\\ndemanded.', 'Captain Delano crossed over to him, and stood in silence surveying the knot;\\nhis mind, by a not uncongenial transition, passing from its own entanglements\\nto those of the hemp. For intricacy, such a knot he had never seen in an\\nAmerican ship, nor indeed any other. The old man looked like an Egyptian\\npriest, making Gordian knots for the temple of Ammon. The knot seemed a\\ncombination of double-bowline-knot, treble-crown-knot, back-handed-well-knot,\\nknot-in-and-out-knot, and jamming-knot.', 'At last, puzzled to comprehend the meaning of such a knot, Captain Delano\\naddressed the knotter:—', '“What are you knotting there, my man?”', '“The knot,” was the brief reply, without looking up.', '“So it seems; but what is it for?”', '“For some one else to undo,” muttered back the old man, plying his\\nfingers harder than ever, the knot being now nearly completed.', 'While Captain Delano stood watching him, suddenly the old man threw the knot\\ntowards him, saying in broken English—the first heard in the\\nship—something to this effect: “Undo it, cut it, quick.” It\\nwas said lowly, but with such condensation of rapidity, that the long, slow\\nwords in Spanish, which had preceded and followed, almost operated as covers to\\nthe brief English between.', 'For a moment, knot in hand, and knot in head, Captain Delano stood mute; while,\\nwithout further heeding him, the old man was now intent upon other ropes.\\nPresently there was a slight stir behind Captain Delano. Turning, he saw the\\nchained negro, Atufal, standing quietly there. The next moment the old sailor\\nrose, muttering, and, followed by his subordinate negroes, removed to the\\nforward part of the ship, where in the crowd he disappeared.', 'An elderly negro, in a clout like an infant’s, and with a pepper and salt\\nhead, and a kind of attorney air, now approached Captain Delano. In tolerable\\nSpanish, and with a good-natured, knowing wink, he informed him that the old\\nknotter was simple-witted, but harmless; often playing his odd tricks. The\\nnegro concluded by begging the knot, for of course the stranger would not care\\nto be troubled with it. Unconsciously, it was handed to him. With a sort of\\ncongé, the negro received it, and, turning his back, ferreted into it like a\\ndetective custom-house officer after smuggled laces. Soon, with some African\\nword, equivalent to pshaw, he tossed the knot overboard.', 'All this is very queer now, thought Captain Delano, with a qualmish sort of\\nemotion; but, as one feeling incipient sea-sickness, he strove, by ignoring the\\nsymptoms, to get rid of the malady. Once more he looked off for his boat. To\\nhis delight, it was now again in view, leaving the rocky spur astern.', 'The sensation here experienced, after at first relieving his uneasiness, with\\nunforeseen efficacy soon began to remove it. The less distant sight of that\\nwell-known boat—showing it, not as before, half blended with the haze,\\nbut with outline defined, so that its individuality, like a man’s, was\\nmanifest; that boat, Rover by name, which, though now in strange seas, had\\noften pressed the beach of Captain Delano’s home, and, brought to its\\nthreshold for repairs, had familiarly lain there, as a Newfoundland dog; the\\nsight of that household boat evoked a thousand trustful associations, which,\\ncontrasted with previous suspicions, filled him not only with lightsome\\nconfidence, but somehow with half humorous self-reproaches at his former lack\\nof it.', '“What, I, Amasa Delano—Jack of the Beach, as they called me when a\\nlad—I, Amasa; the same that, duck-satchel in hand, used to paddle along\\nthe water-side to the school-house made from the old hulk—I, little Jack\\nof the Beach, that used to go berrying with cousin Nat and the rest; I to be\\nmurdered here at the ends of the earth, on board a haunted pirate-ship by a\\nhorrible Spaniard? Too nonsensical to think of! Who would murder Amasa Delano?\\nHis conscience is clean. There is some one above. Fie, fie, Jack of the Beach!\\nyou are a child indeed; a child of the second childhood, old boy; you are\\nbeginning to dote and drule, I’m afraid.”', 'Light of heart and foot, he stepped aft, and there was met by Don\\nBenito’s servant, who, with a pleasing expression, responsive to his own\\npresent feelings, informed him that his master had recovered from the effects\\nof his coughing fit, and had just ordered him to go present his compliments to\\nhis good guest, Don Amasa, and say that he (Don Benito) would soon have the\\nhappiness to rejoin him.', 'There now, do you mark that? again thought Captain Delano, walking the poop.\\nWhat a donkey I was. This kind gentleman who here sends me his kind\\ncompliments, he, but ten minutes ago, dark-lantern in had, was dodging round\\nsome old grind-stone in the hold, sharpening a hatchet for me, I thought. Well,\\nwell; these long calms have a morbid effect on the mind, I’ve often\\nheard, though I never believed it before. Ha! glancing towards the boat;\\nthere’s Rover; good dog; a white bone in her mouth. A pretty big bone\\nthough, seems to me.—What? Yes, she has fallen afoul of the bubbling\\ntide-rip there. It sets her the other way, too, for the time. Patience.', 'It was now about noon, though, from the grayness of everything, it seemed to be\\ngetting towards dusk.', 'The calm was confirmed. In the far distance, away from the influence of land,\\nthe leaden ocean seemed laid out and leaded up, its course finished, soul gone,\\ndefunct. But the current from landward, where the ship was, increased; silently\\nsweeping her further and further towards the tranced waters beyond.', 'Still, from his knowledge of those latitudes, cherishing hopes of a breeze, and\\na fair and fresh one, at any moment, Captain Delano, despite present prospects,\\nbuoyantly counted upon bringing the San Dominick safely to anchor ere night.\\nThe distance swept over was nothing; since, with a good wind, ten\\nminutes’ sailing would retrace more than sixty minutes, drifting.\\nMeantime, one moment turning to mark “Rover” fighting the tide-rip,\\nand the next to see Don Benito approaching, he continued walking the poop.', 'Gradually he felt a vexation arising from the delay of his boat; this soon\\nmerged into uneasiness; and at last—his eye falling continually, as from\\na stage-box into the pit, upon the strange crowd before and below him, and,\\nby-and-by, recognizing there the face—now composed to\\nindifference—of the Spanish sailor who had seemed to beckon from the\\nmain-chains—something of his old trepidations returned.', 'Ah, thought he—gravely enough—this is like the ague: because it\\nwent off, it follows not that it won’t come back.', 'Though ashamed of the relapse, he could not altogether subdue it; and so,\\nexerting his good-nature to the utmost, insensibly he came to a compromise.', 'Yes, this is a strange craft; a strange history, too, and strange folks on\\nboard. But—nothing more.', 'By way of keeping his mind out of mischief till the boat should arrive, he\\ntried to occupy it with turning over and over, in a purely speculative sort of\\nway, some lesser peculiarities of the captain and crew. Among others, four\\ncurious points recurred:', 'First, the affair of the Spanish lad assailed with a knife by the slave boy; an\\nact winked at by Don Benito. Second, the tyranny in Don Benito’s\\ntreatment of Atufal, the black; as if a child should lead a bull of the Nile by\\nthe ring in his nose. Third, the trampling of the sailor by the two negroes; a\\npiece of insolence passed over without so much as a reprimand. Fourth, the\\ncringing submission to their master, of all the ship’s underlings, mostly\\nblacks; as if by the least inadvertence they feared to draw down his despotic\\ndispleasure.', 'Coupling these points, they seemed somewhat contradictory. But what then,\\nthought Captain Delano, glancing towards his now nearing boat—what then?\\nWhy, Don Benito is a very capricious commander. But he is not the first of the\\nsort I have seen; though it’s true he rather exceeds any other. But as a\\nnation—continued he in his reveries—these Spaniards are all an odd\\nset; the very word Spaniard has a curious, conspirator, Guy-Fawkish twang to\\nit. And yet, I dare say, Spaniards in the main are as good folks as any in\\nDuxbury, Massachusetts. Ah good! At last “Rover” has come.', 'As, with its welcome freight, the boat touched the side, the oakum-pickers,\\nwith venerable gestures, sought to restrain the blacks, who, at the sight of\\nthree gurried water-casks in its bottom, and a pile of wilted pumpkins in its\\nbow, hung over the bulwarks in disorderly raptures.', 'Don Benito, with his servant, now appeared; his coming, perhaps, hastened by\\nhearing the noise. Of him Captain Delano sought permission to serve out the\\nwater, so that all might share alike, and none injure themselves by unfair\\nexcess. But sensible, and, on Don Benito’s account, kind as this offer\\nwas, it was received with what seemed impatience; as if aware that he lacked\\nenergy as a commander, Don Benito, with the true jealousy of weakness, resented\\nas an affront any interference. So, at least, Captain Delano inferred.', 'In another moment the casks were being hoisted in, when some of the eager\\nnegroes accidentally jostled Captain Delano, where he stood by the gangway; so,\\nthat, unmindful of Don Benito, yielding to the impulse of the moment, with\\ngood-natured authority he bade the blacks stand back; to enforce his words\\nmaking use of a half-mirthful, half-menacing gesture. Instantly the blacks\\npaused, just where they were, each negro and negress suspended in his or her\\nposture, exactly as the word had found them—for a few seconds continuing\\nso—while, as between the responsive posts of a telegraph, an unknown\\nsyllable ran from man to man among the perched oakum-pickers. While the\\nvisitor’s attention was fixed by this scene, suddenly the\\nhatchet-polishers half rose, and a rapid cry came from Don Benito.', 'Thinking that at the signal of the Spaniard he was about to be massacred,\\nCaptain Delano would have sprung for his boat, but paused, as the\\noakum-pickers, dropping down into the crowd with earnest exclamations, forced\\nevery white and every negro back, at the same moment, with gestures friendly\\nand familiar, almost jocose, bidding him, in substance, not be a fool.\\nSimultaneously the hatchet-polishers resumed their seats, quietly as so many\\ntailors, and at once, as if nothing had happened, the work of hoisting in the\\ncasks was resumed, whites and blacks singing at the tackle.', 'Captain Delano glanced towards Don Benito. As he saw his meagre form in the act\\nof recovering itself from reclining in the servant’s arms, into which the\\nagitated invalid had fallen, he could not but marvel at the panic by which\\nhimself had been surprised, on the darting supposition that such a commander,\\nwho, upon a legitimate occasion, so trivial, too, as it now appeared, could\\nlose all self-command, was, with energetic iniquity, going to bring about his\\nmurder.', 'The casks being on deck, Captain Delano was handed a number of jars and cups by\\none of the steward’s aids, who, in the name of his captain, entreated him\\nto do as he had proposed—dole out the water. He complied, with republican\\nimpartiality as to this republican element, which always seeks one level,\\nserving the oldest white no better than the youngest black; excepting, indeed,\\npoor Don Benito, whose condition, if not rank, demanded an extra allowance. To\\nhim, in the first place, Captain Delano presented a fair pitcher of the fluid;\\nbut, thirsting as he was for it, the Spaniard quaffed not a drop until after\\nseveral grave bows and salutes. A reciprocation of courtesies which the\\nsight-loving Africans hailed with clapping of hands.', 'Two of the less wilted pumpkins being reserved for the cabin table, the residue\\nwere minced up on the spot for the general regalement. But the soft bread,\\nsugar, and bottled cider, Captain Delano would have given the whites alone, and\\nin chief Don Benito; but the latter objected; which disinterestedness not a\\nlittle pleased the American; and so mouthfuls all around were given alike to\\nwhites and blacks; excepting one bottle of cider, which Babo insisted upon\\nsetting aside for his master.', 'Here it may be observed that as, on the first visit of the boat, the American\\nhad not permitted his men to board the ship, neither did he now; being\\nunwilling to add to the confusion of the decks.', 'Not uninfluenced by the peculiar good-humor at present prevailing, and for the\\ntime oblivious of any but benevolent thoughts, Captain Delano, who, from recent\\nindications, counted upon a breeze within an hour or two at furthest,\\ndispatched the boat back to the sealer, with orders for all the hands that\\ncould be spared immediately to set about rafting casks to the watering-place\\nand filling them. Likewise he bade word be carried to his chief officer, that\\nif, against present expectation, the ship was not brought to anchor by sunset,\\nhe need be under no concern; for as there was to be a full moon that night, he\\n(Captain Delano) would remain on board ready to play the pilot, come the wind\\nsoon or late.', 'As the two Captains stood together, observing the departing boat—the\\nservant, as it happened, having just spied a spot on his master’s velvet\\nsleeve, and silently engaged rubbing it out—the American expressed his\\nregrets that the San Dominick had no boats; none, at least, but the unseaworthy\\nold hulk of the long-boat, which, warped as a camel’s skeleton in the\\ndesert, and almost as bleached, lay pot-wise inverted amidships, one side a\\nlittle tipped, furnishing a subterraneous sort of den for family groups of the\\nblacks, mostly women and small children; who, squatting on old mats below, or\\nperched above in the dark dome, on the elevated seats, were descried, some\\ndistance within, like a social circle of bats, sheltering in some friendly\\ncave; at intervals, ebon flights of naked boys and girls, three or four years\\nold, darting in and out of the den’s mouth.', '“Had you three or four boats now, Don Benito,” said Captain Delano,\\n“I think that, by tugging at the oars, your negroes here might help along\\nmatters some. Did you sail from port without boats, Don Benito?”', '“They were stove in the gales, Señor.”', '“That was bad. Many men, too, you lost then. Boats and men. Those must\\nhave been hard gales, Don Benito.”', '“Past all speech,” cringed the Spaniard.', '“Tell me, Don Benito,” continued his companion with increased\\ninterest, “tell me, were these gales immediately off the pitch of Cape\\nHorn?”', '“Cape Horn?—who spoke of Cape Horn?”', '“Yourself did, when giving me an account of your voyage,” answered\\nCaptain Delano, with almost equal astonishment at this eating of his own words,\\neven as he ever seemed eating his own heart, on the part of the Spaniard.\\n“You yourself, Don Benito, spoke of Cape Horn,” he emphatically\\nrepeated.', 'The Spaniard turned, in a sort of stooping posture, pausing an instant, as one\\nabout to make a plunging exchange of elements, as from air to water.', 'At this moment a messenger-boy, a white, hurried by, in the regular performance\\nof his function carrying the last expired half hour forward to the forecastle,\\nfrom the cabin time-piece, to have it struck at the ship’s large bell.', '“Master,” said the servant, discontinuing his work on the coat\\nsleeve, and addressing the rapt Spaniard with a sort of timid apprehensiveness,\\nas one charged with a duty, the discharge of which, it was foreseen, would\\nprove irksome to the very person who had imposed it, and for whose benefit it\\nwas intended, “master told me never mind where he was, or how engaged,\\nalways to remind him to a minute, when shaving-time comes. Miguel has gone to\\nstrike the half-hour afternoon. It is now, master. Will master go into\\nthe cuddy?”', '“Ah—yes,” answered the Spaniard, starting, as from dreams\\ninto realities; then turning upon Captain Delano, he said that ere long he\\nwould resume the conversation.', '“Then if master means to talk more to Don Amasa,” said the servant,\\n“why not let Don Amasa sit by master in the cuddy, and master can talk,\\nand Don Amasa can listen, while Babo here lathers and strops.”', '“Yes,” said Captain Delano, not unpleased with this sociable plan,\\n“yes, Don Benito, unless you had rather not, I will go with you.”', '“Be it so, Señor.”', 'As the three passed aft, the American could not but think it another strange\\ninstance of his host’s capriciousness, this being shaved with such\\nuncommon punctuality in the middle of the day. But he deemed it more than\\nlikely that the servant’s anxious fidelity had something to do with the\\nmatter; inasmuch as the timely interruption served to rally his master from the\\nmood which had evidently been coming upon him.', 'The place called the cuddy was a light deck-cabin formed by the poop, a sort of\\nattic to the large cabin below. Part of it had formerly been the quarters of\\nthe officers; but since their death all the partitioning had been thrown down,\\nand the whole interior converted into one spacious and airy marine hall; for\\nabsence of fine furniture and picturesque disarray of odd appurtenances,\\nsomewhat answering to the wide, cluttered hall of some eccentric\\nbachelor-squire in the country, who hangs his shooting-jacket and tobacco-pouch\\non deer antlers, and keeps his fishing-rod, tongs, and walking-stick in the\\nsame corner.', 'The similitude was heightened, if not originally suggested, by glimpses of the\\nsurrounding sea; since, in one aspect, the country and the ocean seem\\ncousins-german.', 'The floor of the cuddy was matted. Overhead, four or five old muskets were\\nstuck into horizontal holes along the beams. On one side was a claw-footed old\\ntable lashed to the deck; a thumbed missal on it, and over it a small, meagre\\ncrucifix attached to the bulk-head. Under the table lay a dented cutlass or\\ntwo, with a hacked harpoon, among some melancholy old rigging, like a heap of\\npoor friars’ girdles. There were also two long, sharp-ribbed settees of\\nMalacca cane, black with age, and uncomfortable to look at as\\ninquisitors’ racks, with a large, misshapen arm-chair, which, furnished\\nwith a rude barber’s crotch at the back, working with a screw, seemed\\nsome grotesque engine of torment. A flag locker was in one corner, open,\\nexposing various colored bunting, some rolled up, others half unrolled, still\\nothers tumbled. Opposite was a cumbrous washstand, of black mahogany, all of\\none block, with a pedestal, like a font, and over it a railed shelf, containing\\ncombs, brushes, and other implements of the toilet. A torn hammock of stained\\ngrass swung near; the sheets tossed, and the pillow wrinkled up like a brow, as\\nif who ever slept here slept but illy, with alternate visitations of sad\\nthoughts and bad dreams.', 'The further extremity of the cuddy, overhanging the ship’s stern, was\\npierced with three openings, windows or port-holes, according as men or cannon\\nmight peer, socially or unsocially, out of them. At present neither men nor\\ncannon were seen, though huge ring-bolts and other rusty iron fixtures of the\\nwood-work hinted of twenty-four-pounders.', 'Glancing towards the hammock as he entered, Captain Delano said, “You\\nsleep here, Don Benito?”', '“Yes, Señor, since we got into mild weather.”', '“This seems a sort of dormitory, sitting-room, sail-loft, chapel, armory,\\nand private closet all together, Don Benito,” added Captain Delano,\\nlooking round.', '“Yes, Señor; events have not been favorable to much order in my\\narrangements.”', 'Here the servant, napkin on arm, made a motion as if waiting his master’s\\ngood pleasure. Don Benito signified his readiness, when, seating him in the\\nMalacca arm-chair, and for the guest’s convenience drawing opposite one\\nof the settees, the servant commenced operations by throwing back his\\nmaster’s collar and loosening his cravat.', 'There is something in the negro which, in a peculiar way, fits him for\\navocations about one’s person. Most negroes are natural valets and\\nhair-dressers; taking to the comb and brush congenially as to the castinets,\\nand flourishing them apparently with almost equal satisfaction. There is, too,\\na smooth tact about them in this employment, with a marvelous, noiseless,\\ngliding briskness, not ungraceful in its way, singularly pleasing to behold,\\nand still more so to be the manipulated subject of. And above all is the great\\ngift of good-humor. Not the mere grin or laugh is here meant. Those were\\nunsuitable. But a certain easy cheerfulness, harmonious in every glance and\\ngesture; as though God had set the whole negro to some pleasant tune.', 'When to this is added the docility arising from the unaspiring contentment of a\\nlimited mind and that susceptibility of blind attachment sometimes inhering in\\nindisputable inferiors, one readily perceives why those hypochondriacs, Johnson\\nand Byron—it may be, something like the hypochondriac Benito\\nCereno—took to their hearts, almost to the exclusion of the entire white\\nrace, their serving men, the negroes, Barber and Fletcher. But if there be that\\nin the negro which exempts him from the inflicted sourness of the morbid or\\ncynical mind, how, in his most prepossessing aspects, must he appear to a\\nbenevolent one? When at ease with respect to exterior things, Captain\\nDelano’s nature was not only benign, but familiarly and humorously so. At\\nhome, he had often taken rare satisfaction in sitting in his door, watching\\nsome free man of color at his work or play. If on a voyage he chanced to have a\\nblack sailor, invariably he was on chatty and half-gamesome terms with him. In\\nfact, like most men of a good, blithe heart, Captain Delano took to negroes,\\nnot philanthropically, but genially, just as other men to Newfoundland dogs.', 'Hitherto, the circumstances in which he found the San Dominick had repressed\\nthe tendency. But in the cuddy, relieved from his former uneasiness, and, for\\nvarious reasons, more sociably inclined than at any previous period of the day,\\nand seeing the colored servant, napkin on arm, so debonair about his master, in\\na business so familiar as that of shaving, too, all his old weakness for\\nnegroes returned.', 'Among other things, he was amused with an odd instance of the African love of\\nbright colors and fine shows, in the black’s informally taking from the\\nflag-locker a great piece of bunting of all hues, and lavishly tucking it under\\nhis master’s chin for an apron.', 'The mode of shaving among the Spaniards is a little different from what it is\\nwith other nations. They have a basin, specifically called a barber’s\\nbasin, which on one side is scooped out, so as accurately to receive the chin,\\nagainst which it is closely held in lathering; which is done, not with a brush,\\nbut with soap dipped in the water of the basin and rubbed on the face.', 'In the present instance salt-water was used for lack of better; and the parts\\nlathered were only the upper lip, and low down under the throat, all the rest\\nbeing cultivated beard.', 'The preliminaries being somewhat novel to Captain Delano, he sat curiously\\neying them, so that no conversation took place, nor, for the present, did Don\\nBenito appear disposed to renew any.', 'Setting down his basin, the negro searched among the razors, as for the\\nsharpest, and having found it, gave it an additional edge by expertly strapping\\nit on the firm, smooth, oily skin of his open palm; he then made a gesture as\\nif to begin, but midway stood suspended for an instant, one hand elevating the\\nrazor, the other professionally dabbling among the bubbling suds on the\\nSpaniard’s lank neck. Not unaffected by the close sight of the gleaming\\nsteel, Don Benito nervously shuddered; his usual ghastliness was heightened by\\nthe lather, which lather, again, was intensified in its hue by the contrasting\\nsootiness of the negro’s body. Altogether the scene was somewhat\\npeculiar, at least to Captain Delano, nor, as he saw the two thus postured,\\ncould he resist the vagary, that in the black he saw a headsman, and in the\\nwhite a man at the block. But this was one of those antic conceits, appearing\\nand vanishing in a breath, from which, perhaps, the best regulated mind is not\\nalways free.', 'Meantime the agitation of the Spaniard had a little loosened the bunting from\\naround him, so that one broad fold swept curtain-like over the chair-arm to the\\nfloor, revealing, amid a profusion of armorial bars and\\nground-colors—black, blue, and yellow—a closed castle in a blood\\nred field diagonal with a lion rampant in a white.', '“The castle and the lion,” exclaimed Captain\\nDelano—“why, Don Benito, this is the flag of Spain you use here.\\nIt’s well it’s only I, and not the King, that sees this,” he\\nadded, with a smile, “but”—turning towards the\\nblack—“it’s all one, I suppose, so the colors be gay;”\\nwhich playful remark did not fail somewhat to tickle the negro.', '“Now, master,” he said, readjusting the flag, and pressing the head\\ngently further back into the crotch of the chair; “now, master,”\\nand the steel glanced nigh the throat.', 'Again Don Benito faintly shuddered.', '“You must not shake so, master. See, Don Amasa, master always shakes when\\nI shave him. And yet master knows I never yet have drawn blood, though\\nit’s true, if master will shake so, I may some of these times. Now\\nmaster,” he continued. “And now, Don Amasa, please go on with your\\ntalk about the gale, and all that; master can hear, and, between times, master\\ncan answer.”', '“Ah yes, these gales,” said Captain Delano; “but the more I\\nthink of your voyage, Don Benito, the more I wonder, not at the gales, terrible\\nas they must have been, but at the disastrous interval following them. For\\nhere, by your account, have you been these two months and more getting from\\nCape Horn to St. Maria, a distance which I myself, with a good wind, have\\nsailed in a few days. True, you had calms, and long ones, but to be becalmed\\nfor two months, that is, at least, unusual. Why, Don Benito, had almost any\\nother gentleman told me such a story, I should have been half disposed to a\\nlittle incredulity.”', 'Here an involuntary expression came over the Spaniard, similar to that just\\nbefore on the deck, and whether it was the start he gave, or a sudden gawky\\nroll of the hull in the calm, or a momentary unsteadiness of the\\nservant’s hand, however it was, just then the razor drew blood, spots of\\nwhich stained the creamy lather under the throat: immediately the black barber\\ndrew back his steel, and, remaining in his professional attitude, back to\\nCaptain Delano, and face to Don Benito, held up the trickling razor, saying,\\nwith a sort of half humorous sorrow, “See, master—you shook\\nso—here’s Babo’s first blood.”', 'No sword drawn before James the First of England, no assassination in that\\ntimid King’s presence, could have produced a more terrified aspect than\\nwas now presented by Don Benito.', 'Poor fellow, thought Captain Delano, so nervous he can’t even bear the\\nsight of barber’s blood; and this unstrung, sick man, is it credible that\\nI should have imagined he meant to spill all my blood, who can’t endure\\nthe sight of one little drop of his own? Surely, Amasa Delano, you have been\\nbeside yourself this day. Tell it not when you get home, sappy Amasa. Well,\\nwell, he looks like a murderer, doesn’t he? More like as if himself were\\nto be done for. Well, well, this day’s experience shall be a good lesson.', 'Meantime, while these things were running through the honest seaman’s\\nmind, the servant had taken the napkin from his arm, and to Don Benito had\\nsaid—“But answer Don Amasa, please, master, while I wipe this ugly\\nstuff off the razor, and strop it again.”', 'As he said the words, his face was turned half round, so as to be alike visible\\nto the Spaniard and the American, and seemed, by its expression, to hint, that\\nhe was desirous, by getting his master to go on with the conversation,\\nconsiderately to withdraw his attention from the recent annoying accident. As\\nif glad to snatch the offered relief, Don Benito resumed, rehearsing to Captain\\nDelano, that not only were the calms of unusual duration, but the ship had\\nfallen in with obstinate currents; and other things he added, some of which\\nwere but repetitions of former statements, to explain how it came to pass that\\nthe passage from Cape Horn to St. Maria had been so exceedingly long; now and\\nthen, mingling with his words, incidental praises, less qualified than before,\\nto the blacks, for their general good conduct. These particulars were not given\\nconsecutively, the servant, at convenient times, using his razor, and so,\\nbetween the intervals of shaving, the story and panegyric went on with more\\nthan usual huskiness.', 'To Captain Delano’s imagination, now again not wholly at rest, there was\\nsomething so hollow in the Spaniard’s manner, with apparently some\\nreciprocal hollowness in the servant’s dusky comment of silence, that the\\nidea flashed across him, that possibly master and man, for some unknown\\npurpose, were acting out, both in word and deed, nay, to the very tremor of Don\\nBenito’s limbs, some juggling play before him. Neither did the suspicion\\nof collusion lack apparent support, from the fact of those whispered\\nconferences before mentioned. But then, what could be the object of enacting\\nthis play of the barber before him? At last, regarding the notion as a whimsy,\\ninsensibly suggested, perhaps, by the theatrical aspect of Don Benito in his\\nharlequin ensign, Captain Delano speedily banished it.', 'The shaving over, the servant bestirred himself with a small bottle of scented\\nwaters, pouring a few drops on the head, and then diligently rubbing; the\\nvehemence of the exercise causing the muscles of his face to twitch rather\\nstrangely.', 'His next operation was with comb, scissors, and brush; going round and round,\\nsmoothing a curl here, clipping an unruly whisker-hair there, giving a graceful\\nsweep to the temple-lock, with other impromptu touches evincing the hand of a\\nmaster; while, like any resigned gentleman in barber’s hands, Don Benito\\nbore all, much less uneasily, at least than he had done the razoring; indeed,\\nhe sat so pale and rigid now, that the negro seemed a Nubian sculptor finishing\\noff a white statue-head.', 'All being over at last, the standard of Spain removed, tumbled up, and tossed\\nback into the flag-locker, the negro’s warm breath blowing away any stray\\nhair, which might have lodged down his master’s neck; collar and cravat\\nreadjusted; a speck of lint whisked off the velvet lapel; all this being done;\\nbacking off a little space, and pausing with an expression of subdued\\nself-complacency, the servant for a moment surveyed his master, as, in toilet\\nat least, the creature of his own tasteful hands.', 'Captain Delano playfully complimented him upon his achievement; at the same\\ntime congratulating Don Benito.', 'But neither sweet waters, nor shampooing, nor fidelity, nor sociality,\\ndelighted the Spaniard. Seeing him relapsing into forbidding gloom, and still\\nremaining seated, Captain Delano, thinking that his presence was undesired just\\nthen, withdrew, on pretense of seeing whether, as he had prophesied, any signs\\nof a breeze were visible.', 'Walking forward to the main-mast, he stood awhile thinking over the scene, and\\nnot without some undefined misgivings, when he heard a noise near the cuddy,\\nand turning, saw the negro, his hand to his cheek. Advancing, Captain Delano\\nperceived that the cheek was bleeding. He was about to ask the cause, when the\\nnegro’s wailing soliloquy enlightened him.', '“Ah, when will master get better from his sickness; only the sour heart\\nthat sour sickness breeds made him serve Babo so; cutting Babo with the razor,\\nbecause, only by accident, Babo had given master one little scratch; and for\\nthe first time in so many a day, too. Ah, ah, ah,” holding his hand to\\nhis face.', 'Is it possible, thought Captain Delano; was it to wreak in private his Spanish\\nspite against this poor friend of his, that Don Benito, by his sullen manner,\\nimpelled me to withdraw? Ah this slavery breeds ugly passions in\\nman.—Poor fellow!', 'He was about to speak in sympathy to the negro, but with a timid reluctance he\\nnow re-entered the cuddy.', 'Presently master and man came forth; Don Benito leaning on his servant as if\\nnothing had happened.', 'But a sort of love-quarrel, after all, thought Captain Delano.', 'He accosted Don Benito, and they slowly walked together. They had gone but a\\nfew paces, when the steward—a tall, rajah-looking mulatto, orientally set\\noff with a pagoda turban formed by three or four Madras handkerchiefs wound\\nabout his head, tier on tier—approaching with a saalam, announced lunch\\nin the cabin.', 'On their way thither, the two captains were preceded by the mulatto, who,\\nturning round as he advanced, with continual smiles and bows, ushered them on,\\na display of elegance which quite completed the insignificance of the small\\nbare-headed Babo, who, as if not unconscious of inferiority, eyed askance the\\ngraceful steward. But in part, Captain Delano imputed his jealous watchfulness\\nto that peculiar feeling which the full-blooded African entertains for the\\nadulterated one. As for the steward, his manner, if not bespeaking much dignity\\nof self-respect, yet evidenced his extreme desire to please; which is doubly\\nmeritorious, as at once Christian and Chesterfieldian.', 'Captain Delano observed with interest that while the complexion of the mulatto\\nwas hybrid, his physiognomy was European—classically so.', '“Don Benito,” whispered he, “I am glad to see this\\nusher-of-the-golden-rod of yours; the sight refutes an ugly remark once made to\\nme by a Barbadoes planter; that when a mulatto has a regular European face,\\nlook out for him; he is a devil. But see, your steward here has features more\\nregular than King George’s of England; and yet there he nods, and bows,\\nand smiles; a king, indeed—the king of kind hearts and polite fellows.\\nWhat a pleasant voice he has, too?”', '“He has, Señor.”', '“But tell me, has he not, so far as you have known him, always proved a\\ngood, worthy fellow?” said Captain Delano, pausing, while with a final\\ngenuflexion the steward disappeared into the cabin; “come, for the reason\\njust mentioned, I am curious to know.”', '“Francesco is a good man,” a sort of sluggishly responded Don\\nBenito, like a phlegmatic appreciator, who would neither find fault nor\\nflatter.', '“Ah, I thought so. For it were strange, indeed, and not very creditable\\nto us white-skins, if a little of our blood mixed with the African’s,\\nshould, far from improving the latter’s quality, have the sad effect of\\npouring vitriolic acid into black broth; improving the hue, perhaps, but not\\nthe wholesomeness.”', '“Doubtless, doubtless, Señor, but”—glancing at\\nBabo—“not to speak of negroes, your planter’s remark I have\\nheard applied to the Spanish and Indian intermixtures in our provinces. But I\\nknow nothing about the matter,” he listlessly added.', 'And here they entered the cabin.', 'The lunch was a frugal one. Some of Captain Delano’s fresh fish and\\npumpkins, biscuit and salt beef, the reserved bottle of cider, and the San\\nDominick’s last bottle of Canary.', 'As they entered, Francesco, with two or three colored aids, was hovering over\\nthe table giving the last adjustments. Upon perceiving their master they\\nwithdrew, Francesco making a smiling congé, and the Spaniard, without\\ncondescending to notice it, fastidiously remarking to his companion that he\\nrelished not superfluous attendance.', 'Without companions, host and guest sat down, like a childless married couple,\\nat opposite ends of the table, Don Benito waving Captain Delano to his place,\\nand, weak as he was, insisting upon that gentleman being seated before himself.', 'The negro placed a rug under Don Benito’s feet, and a cushion behind his\\nback, and then stood behind, not his master’s chair, but Captain\\nDelano’s. At first, this a little surprised the latter. But it was soon\\nevident that, in taking his position, the black was still true to his master;\\nsince by facing him he could the more readily anticipate his slightest want.', '“This is an uncommonly intelligent fellow of yours, Don Benito,”\\nwhispered Captain Delano across the table.', '“You say true, Señor.”', 'During the repast, the guest again reverted to parts of Don Benito’s\\nstory, begging further particulars here and there. He inquired how it was that\\nthe scurvy and fever should have committed such wholesale havoc upon the\\nwhites, while destroying less than half of the blacks. As if this question\\nreproduced the whole scene of plague before the Spaniard’s eyes,\\nmiserably reminding him of his solitude in a cabin where before he had had so\\nmany friends and officers round him, his hand shook, his face became hueless,\\nbroken words escaped; but directly the sane memory of the past seemed replaced\\nby insane terrors of the present. With starting eyes he stared before him at\\nvacancy. For nothing was to be seen but the hand of his servant pushing the\\nCanary over towards him. At length a few sips served partially to restore him.\\nHe made random reference to the different constitution of races, enabling one\\nto offer more resistance to certain maladies than another. The thought was new\\nto his companion.', 'Presently Captain Delano, intending to say something to his host concerning the\\npecuniary part of the business he had undertaken for him,\\nespecially—since he was strictly accountable to his owners—with\\nreference to the new suit of sails, and other things of that sort; and\\nnaturally preferring to conduct such affairs in private, was desirous that the\\nservant should withdraw; imagining that Don Benito for a few minutes could\\ndispense with his attendance. He, however, waited awhile; thinking that, as the\\nconversation proceeded, Don Benito, without being prompted, would perceive the\\npropriety of the step.', 'But it was otherwise. At last catching his host’s eye, Captain Delano,\\nwith a slight backward gesture of his thumb, whispered, “Don Benito,\\npardon me, but there is an interference with the full expression of what I have\\nto say to you.”', 'Upon this the Spaniard changed countenance; which was imputed to his resenting\\nthe hint, as in some way a reflection upon his servant. After a moment’s\\npause, he assured his guest that the black’s remaining with them could be\\nof no disservice; because since losing his officers he had made Babo (whose\\noriginal office, it now appeared, had been captain of the slaves) not only his\\nconstant attendant and companion, but in all things his confidant.', 'After this, nothing more could be said; though, indeed, Captain Delano could\\nhardly avoid some little tinge of irritation upon being left ungratified in so\\ninconsiderable a wish, by one, too, for whom he intended such solid services.\\nBut it is only his querulousness, thought he; and so filling his glass he\\nproceeded to business.', 'The price of the sails and other matters was fixed upon. But while this was\\nbeing done, the American observed that, though his original offer of assistance\\nhad been hailed with hectic animation, yet now when it was reduced to a\\nbusiness transaction, indifference and apathy were betrayed. Don Benito, in\\nfact, appeared to submit to hearing the details more out of regard to common\\npropriety, than from any impression that weighty benefit to himself and his\\nvoyage was involved.', 'Soon, his manner became still more reserved. The effort was vain to seek to\\ndraw him into social talk. Gnawed by his splenetic mood, he sat twitching his\\nbeard, while to little purpose the hand of his servant, mute as that on the\\nwall, slowly pushed over the Canary.', 'Lunch being over, they sat down on the cushioned transom; the servant placing a\\npillow behind his master. The long continuance of the calm had now affected the\\natmosphere. Don Benito sighed heavily, as if for breath.', '“Why not adjourn to the cuddy,” said Captain Delano; “there\\nis more air there.” But the host sat silent and motionless.', 'Meantime his servant knelt before him, with a large fan of feathers. And\\nFrancesco coming in on tiptoes, handed the negro a little cup of aromatic\\nwaters, with which at intervals he chafed his master’s brow; smoothing\\nthe hair along the temples as a nurse does a child’s. He spoke no word.\\nHe only rested his eye on his master’s, as if, amid all Don\\nBenito’s distress, a little to refresh his spirit by the silent sight of\\nfidelity.', 'Presently the ship’s bell sounded two o’clock; and through the\\ncabin windows a slight rippling of the sea was discerned; and from the desired\\ndirection.', '“There,” exclaimed Captain Delano, “I told you so, Don\\nBenito, look!”', 'He had risen to his feet, speaking in a very animated tone, with a view the\\nmore to rouse his companion. But though the crimson curtain of the stern-window\\nnear him that moment fluttered against his pale cheek, Don Benito seemed to\\nhave even less welcome for the breeze than the calm.', 'Poor fellow, thought Captain Delano, bitter experience has taught him that one\\nripple does not make a wind, any more than one swallow a summer. But he is\\nmistaken for once. I will get his ship in for him, and prove it.', 'Briefly alluding to his weak condition, he urged his host to remain quietly\\nwhere he was, since he (Captain Delano) would with pleasure take upon himself\\nthe responsibility of making the best use of the wind.', 'Upon gaining the deck, Captain Delano started at the unexpected figure of\\nAtufal, monumentally fixed at the threshold, like one of those sculptured\\nporters of black marble guarding the porches of Egyptian tombs.', 'But this time the start was, perhaps, purely physical. Atufal’s presence,\\nsingularly attesting docility even in sullenness, was contrasted with that of\\nthe hatchet-polishers, who in patience evinced their industry; while both\\nspectacles showed, that lax as Don Benito’s general authority might be,\\nstill, whenever he chose to exert it, no man so savage or colossal but must,\\nmore or less, bow.', 'Snatching a trumpet which hung from the bulwarks, with a free step Captain\\nDelano advanced to the forward edge of the poop, issuing his orders in his best\\nSpanish. The few sailors and many negroes, all equally pleased, obediently set\\nabout heading the ship towards the harbor.', 'While giving some directions about setting a lower stu’n’-sail,\\nsuddenly Captain Delano heard a voice faithfully repeating his orders. Turning,\\nhe saw Babo, now for the time acting, under the pilot, his original part of\\ncaptain of the slaves. This assistance proved valuable. Tattered sails and\\nwarped yards were soon brought into some trim. And no brace or halyard was\\npulled but to the blithe songs of the inspirited negroes.', 'Good fellows, thought Captain Delano, a little training would make fine sailors\\nof them. Why see, the very women pull and sing too. These must be some of those\\nAshantee negresses that make such capital soldiers, I’ve heard. But\\nwho’s at the helm. I must have a good hand there.', 'He went to see.', 'The San Dominick steered with a cumbrous tiller, with large horizontal pullies\\nattached. At each pully-end stood a subordinate black, and between them, at the\\ntiller-head, the responsible post, a Spanish seaman, whose countenance evinced\\nhis due share in the general hopefulness and confidence at the coming of the\\nbreeze.', 'He proved the same man who had behaved with so shame-faced an air on the\\nwindlass.', '“Ah,—it is you, my man,” exclaimed Captain\\nDelano—“well, no more sheep’s-eyes now;—look straight\\nforward and keep the ship so. Good hand, I trust? And want to get into the\\nharbor, don’t you?”', 'The man assented with an inward chuckle, grasping the tiller-head firmly. Upon\\nthis, unperceived by the American, the two blacks eyed the sailor intently.', 'Finding all right at the helm, the pilot went forward to the forecastle, to see\\nhow matters stood there.', 'The ship now had way enough to breast the current. With the approach of\\nevening, the breeze would be sure to freshen.', 'Having done all that was needed for the present, Captain Delano, giving his\\nlast orders to the sailors, turned aft to report affairs to Don Benito in the\\ncabin; perhaps additionally incited to rejoin him by the hope of snatching a\\nmoment’s private chat while the servant was engaged upon deck.', 'From opposite sides, there were, beneath the poop, two approaches to the cabin;\\none further forward than the other, and consequently communicating with a\\nlonger passage. Marking the servant still above, Captain Delano, taking the\\nnighest entrance—the one last named, and at whose porch Atufal still\\nstood—hurried on his way, till, arrived at the cabin threshold, he paused\\nan instant, a little to recover from his eagerness. Then, with the words of his\\nintended business upon his lips, he entered. As he advanced toward the seated\\nSpaniard, he heard another footstep, keeping time with his. From the opposite\\ndoor, a salver in hand, the servant was likewise advancing.', '“Confound the faithful fellow,” thought Captain Delano; “what\\na vexatious coincidence.”', 'Possibly, the vexation might have been something different, were it not for the\\nbrisk confidence inspired by the breeze. But even as it was, he felt a slight\\ntwinge, from a sudden indefinite association in his mind of Babo with Atufal.', '“Don Benito,” said he, “I give you joy; the breeze will hold,\\nand will increase. By the way, your tall man and time-piece, Atufal, stands\\nwithout. By your order, of course?”', 'Don Benito recoiled, as if at some bland satirical touch, delivered with such\\nadroit garnish of apparent good breeding as to present no handle for retort.', 'He is like one flayed alive, thought Captain Delano; where may one touch him\\nwithout causing a shrink?', 'The servant moved before his master, adjusting a cushion; recalled to civility,\\nthe Spaniard stiffly replied: “you are right. The slave appears where you\\nsaw him, according to my command; which is, that if at the given hour I am\\nbelow, he must take his stand and abide my coming.”', '“Ah now, pardon me, but that is treating the poor fellow like an ex-king\\nindeed. Ah, Don Benito,” smiling, “for all the license you permit\\nin some things, I fear lest, at bottom, you are a bitter hard master.”', 'Again Don Benito shrank; and this time, as the good sailor thought, from a\\ngenuine twinge of his conscience.', 'Again conversation became constrained. In vain Captain Delano called attention\\nto the now perceptible motion of the keel gently cleaving the sea; with\\nlack-lustre eye, Don Benito returned words few and reserved.', 'By-and-by, the wind having steadily risen, and still blowing right into the\\nharbor bore the San Dominick swiftly on. Sounding a point of land, the sealer\\nat distance came into open view.', 'Meantime Captain Delano had again repaired to the deck, remaining there some\\ntime. Having at last altered the ship’s course, so as to give the reef a\\nwide berth, he returned for a few moments below.', 'I will cheer up my poor friend, this time, thought he.', '“Better and better,” Don Benito, he cried as he blithely\\nre-entered: “there will soon be an end to your cares, at least for\\nawhile. For when, after a long, sad voyage, you know, the anchor drops into the\\nhaven, all its vast weight seems lifted from the captain’s heart. We are\\ngetting on famously, Don Benito. My ship is in sight. Look through this\\nside-light here; there she is; all a-taunt-o! The Bachelor’s Delight, my\\ngood friend. Ah, how this wind braces one up. Come, you must take a cup of\\ncoffee with me this evening. My old steward will give you as fine a cup as ever\\nany sultan tasted. What say you, Don Benito, will you?”', 'At first, the Spaniard glanced feverishly up, casting a longing look towards\\nthe sealer, while with mute concern his servant gazed into his face. Suddenly\\nthe old ague of coldness returned, and dropping back to his cushions he was\\nsilent.', '“You do not answer. Come, all day you have been my host; would you have\\nhospitality all on one side?”', '“I cannot go,” was the response.', '“What? it will not fatigue you. The ships will lie together as near as\\nthey can, without swinging foul. It will be little more than stepping from deck\\nto deck; which is but as from room to room. Come, come, you must not refuse\\nme.”', '“I cannot go,” decisively and repulsively repeated Don Benito.', 'Renouncing all but the last appearance of courtesy, with a sort of cadaverous\\nsullenness, and biting his thin nails to the quick, he glanced, almost glared,\\nat his guest, as if impatient that a stranger’s presence should interfere\\nwith the full indulgence of his morbid hour. Meantime the sound of the parted\\nwaters came more and more gurglingly and merrily in at the windows; as\\nreproaching him for his dark spleen; as telling him that, sulk as he might, and\\ngo mad with it, nature cared not a jot; since, whose fault was it, pray?', 'But the foul mood was now at its depth, as the fair wind at its height.', 'There was something in the man so far beyond any mere unsociality or sourness\\npreviously evinced, that even the forbearing good-nature of his guest could no\\nlonger endure it. Wholly at a loss to account for such demeanor, and deeming\\nsickness with eccentricity, however extreme, no adequate excuse, well\\nsatisfied, too, that nothing in his own conduct could justify it, Captain\\nDelano’s pride began to be roused. Himself became reserved. But all\\nseemed one to the Spaniard. Quitting him, therefore, Captain Delano once more\\nwent to the deck.', 'The ship was now within less than two miles of the sealer. The whale-boat was\\nseen darting over the interval.', 'To be brief, the two vessels, thanks to the pilot’s skill, ere long\\nneighborly style lay anchored together.', 'Before returning to his own vessel, Captain Delano had intended communicating\\nto Don Benito the smaller details of the proposed services to be rendered. But,\\nas it was, unwilling anew to subject himself to rebuffs, he resolved, now that\\nhe had seen the San Dominick safely moored, immediately to quit her, without\\nfurther allusion to hospitality or business. Indefinitely postponing his\\nulterior plans, he would regulate his future actions according to future\\ncircumstances. His boat was ready to receive him; but his host still tarried\\nbelow. Well, thought Captain Delano, if he has little breeding, the more need\\nto show mine. He descended to the cabin to bid a ceremonious, and, it may be,\\ntacitly rebukeful adieu. But to his great satisfaction, Don Benito, as if he\\nbegan to feel the weight of that treatment with which his slighted guest had,\\nnot indecorously, retaliated upon him, now supported by his servant, rose to\\nhis feet, and grasping Captain Delano’s hand, stood tremulous; too much\\nagitated to speak. But the good augury hence drawn was suddenly dashed, by his\\nresuming all his previous reserve, with augmented gloom, as, with half-averted\\neyes, he silently reseated himself on his cushions. With a corresponding return\\nof his own chilled feelings, Captain Delano bowed and withdrew.', 'He was hardly midway in the narrow corridor, dim as a tunnel, leading from the\\ncabin to the stairs, when a sound, as of the tolling for execution in some\\njail-yard, fell on his ears. It was the echo of the ship’s flawed bell,\\nstriking the hour, drearily reverberated in this subterranean vault. Instantly,\\nby a fatality not to be withstood, his mind, responsive to the portent, swarmed\\nwith superstitious suspicions. He paused. In images far swifter than these\\nsentences, the minutest details of all his former distrusts swept through him.', 'Hitherto, credulous good-nature had been too ready to furnish excuses for\\nreasonable fears. Why was the Spaniard, so superfluously punctilious at times,\\nnow heedless of common propriety in not accompanying to the side his departing\\nguest? Did indisposition forbid? Indisposition had not forbidden more irksome\\nexertion that day. His last equivocal demeanor recurred. He had risen to his\\nfeet, grasped his guest’s hand, motioned toward his hat; then, in an\\ninstant, all was eclipsed in sinister muteness and gloom. Did this imply one\\nbrief, repentant relenting at the final moment, from some iniquitous plot,\\nfollowed by remorseless return to it? His last glance seemed to express a\\ncalamitous, yet acquiescent farewell to Captain Delano forever. Why decline the\\ninvitation to visit the sealer that evening? Or was the Spaniard less hardened\\nthan the Jew, who refrained not from supping at the board of him whom the same\\nnight he meant to betray? What imported all those day-long enigmas and\\ncontradictions, except they were intended to mystify, preliminary to some\\nstealthy blow? Atufal, the pretended rebel, but punctual shadow, that moment\\nlurked by the threshold without. He seemed a sentry, and more. Who, by his own\\nconfession, had stationed him there? Was the negro now lying in wait?', 'The Spaniard behind—his creature before: to rush from darkness to light\\nwas the involuntary choice.', 'The next moment, with clenched jaw and hand, he passed Atufal, and stood\\nunharmed in the light. As he saw his trim ship lying peacefully at anchor, and\\nalmost within ordinary call; as he saw his household boat, with familiar faces\\nin it, patiently rising and falling, on the short waves by the San\\nDominick’s side; and then, glancing about the decks where he stood, saw\\nthe oakum-pickers still gravely plying their fingers; and heard the low,\\nbuzzing whistle and industrious hum of the hatchet-polishers, still bestirring\\nthemselves over their endless occupation; and more than all, as he saw the\\nbenign aspect of nature, taking her innocent repose in the evening; the\\nscreened sun in the quiet camp of the west shining out like the mild light from\\nAbraham’s tent; as charmed eye and ear took in all these, with the\\nchained figure of the black, clenched jaw and hand relaxed. Once again he\\nsmiled at the phantoms which had mocked him, and felt something like a tinge of\\nremorse, that, by harboring them even for a moment, he should, by implication,\\nhave betrayed an atheist doubt of the ever-watchful Providence above.', 'There was a few minutes’ delay, while, in obedience to his orders, the\\nboat was being hooked along to the gangway. During this interval, a sort of\\nsaddened satisfaction stole over Captain Delano, at thinking of the kindly\\noffices he had that day discharged for a stranger. Ah, thought he, after good\\nactions one’s conscience is never ungrateful, however much so the\\nbenefited party may be.', 'Presently, his foot, in the first act of descent into the boat, pressed the\\nfirst round of the side-ladder, his face presented inward upon the deck. In the\\nsame moment, he heard his name courteously sounded; and, to his pleased\\nsurprise, saw Don Benito advancing—an unwonted energy in his air, as if,\\nat the last moment, intent upon making amends for his recent discourtesy. With\\ninstinctive good feeling, Captain Delano, withdrawing his foot, turned and\\nreciprocally advanced. As he did so, the Spaniard’s nervous eagerness\\nincreased, but his vital energy failed; so that, the better to support him, the\\nservant, placing his master’s hand on his naked shoulder, and gently\\nholding it there, formed himself into a sort of crutch.', 'When the two captains met, the Spaniard again fervently took the hand of the\\nAmerican, at the same time casting an earnest glance into his eyes, but, as\\nbefore, too much overcome to speak.', 'I have done him wrong, self-reproachfully thought Captain Delano; his apparent\\ncoldness has deceived me: in no instance has he meant to offend.', 'Meantime, as if fearful that the continuance of the scene might too much\\nunstring his master, the servant seemed anxious to terminate it. And so, still\\npresenting himself as a crutch, and walking between the two captains, he\\nadvanced with them towards the gangway; while still, as if full of kindly\\ncontrition, Don Benito would not let go the hand of Captain Delano, but\\nretained it in his, across the black’s body.', 'Soon they were standing by the side, looking over into the boat, whose crew\\nturned up their curious eyes. Waiting a moment for the Spaniard to relinquish\\nhis hold, the now embarrassed Captain Delano lifted his foot, to overstep the\\nthreshold of the open gangway; but still Don Benito would not let go his hand.\\nAnd yet, with an agitated tone, he said, “I can go no further; here I\\nmust bid you adieu. Adieu, my dear, dear Don Amasa. Go—go!”\\nsuddenly tearing his hand loose, “go, and God guard you better than me,\\nmy best friend.”', 'Not unaffected, Captain Delano would now have lingered; but catching the meekly\\nadmonitory eye of the servant, with a hasty farewell he descended into his\\nboat, followed by the continual adieus of Don Benito, standing rooted in the\\ngangway.', 'Seating himself in the stern, Captain Delano, making a last salute, ordered the\\nboat shoved off. The crew had their oars on end. The bowsmen pushed the boat a\\nsufficient distance for the oars to be lengthwise dropped. The instant that was\\ndone, Don Benito sprang over the bulwarks, falling at the feet of Captain\\nDelano; at the same time calling towards his ship, but in tones so frenzied,\\nthat none in the boat could understand him. But, as if not equally obtuse,\\nthree sailors, from three different and distant parts of the ship, splashed\\ninto the sea, swimming after their captain, as if intent upon his rescue.', 'The dismayed officer of the boat eagerly asked what this meant. To which,\\nCaptain Delano, turning a disdainful smile upon the unaccountable Spaniard,\\nanswered that, for his part, he neither knew nor cared; but it seemed as if Don\\nBenito had taken it into his head to produce the impression among his people\\nthat the boat wanted to kidnap him. “Or else—give way for your\\nlives,” he wildly added, starting at a clattering hubbub in the ship,\\nabove which rang the tocsin of the hatchet-polishers; and seizing Don Benito by\\nthe throat he added, “this plotting pirate means murder!” Here, in\\napparent verification of the words, the servant, a dagger in his hand, was seen\\non the rail overhead, poised, in the act of leaping, as if with desperate\\nfidelity to befriend his master to the last; while, seemingly to aid the black,\\nthe three white sailors were trying to clamber into the hampered bow. Meantime,\\nthe whole host of negroes, as if inflamed at the sight of their jeopardized\\ncaptain, impended in one sooty avalanche over the bulwarks.', 'All this, with what preceded, and what followed, occurred with such involutions\\nof rapidity, that past, present, and future seemed one.', 'Seeing the negro coming, Captain Delano had flung the Spaniard aside, almost in\\nthe very act of clutching him, and, by the unconscious recoil, shifting his\\nplace, with arms thrown up, so promptly grappled the servant in his descent,\\nthat with dagger presented at Captain Delano’s heart, the black seemed of\\npurpose to have leaped there as to his mark. But the weapon was wrenched away,\\nand the assailant dashed down into the bottom of the boat, which now, with\\ndisentangled oars, began to speed through the sea.', 'At this juncture, the left hand of Captain Delano, on one side, again clutched\\nthe half-reclined Don Benito, heedless that he was in a speechless faint, while\\nhis right-foot, on the other side, ground the prostrate negro; and his right\\narm pressed for added speed on the after oar, his eye bent forward, encouraging\\nhis men to their utmost.', 'But here, the officer of the boat, who had at last succeeded in beating off the\\ntowing sailors, and was now, with face turned aft, assisting the bowsman at his\\noar, suddenly called to Captain Delano, to see what the black was about; while\\na Portuguese oarsman shouted to him to give heed to what the Spaniard was\\nsaying.', 'Glancing down at his feet, Captain Delano saw the freed hand of the servant\\naiming with a second dagger—a small one, before concealed in his\\nwool—with this he was snakishly writhing up from the boat’s bottom,\\nat the heart of his master, his countenance lividly vindictive, expressing the\\ncentred purpose of his soul; while the Spaniard, half-choked, was vainly\\nshrinking away, with husky words, incoherent to all but the Portuguese.', 'That moment, across the long-benighted mind of Captain Delano, a flash of\\nrevelation swept, illuminating, in unanticipated clearness, his host’s\\nwhole mysterious demeanor, with every enigmatic event of the day, as well as\\nthe entire past voyage of the San Dominick. He smote Babo’s hand down,\\nbut his own heart smote him harder. With infinite pity he withdrew his hold\\nfrom Don Benito. Not Captain Delano, but Don Benito, the black, in leaping into\\nthe boat, had intended to stab.', 'Both the black’s hands were held, as, glancing up towards the San\\nDominick, Captain Delano, now with scales dropped from his eyes, saw the\\nnegroes, not in misrule, not in tumult, not as if frantically concerned for Don\\nBenito, but with mask torn away, flourishing hatchets and knives, in ferocious\\npiratical revolt. Like delirious black dervishes, the six Ashantees danced on\\nthe poop. Prevented by their foes from springing into the water, the Spanish\\nboys were hurrying up to the topmost spars, while such of the few Spanish\\nsailors, not already in the sea, less alert, were descried, helplessly mixed\\nin, on deck, with the blacks.', 'Meantime Captain Delano hailed his own vessel, ordering the ports up, and the\\nguns run out. But by this time the cable of the San Dominick had been cut; and\\nthe fag-end, in lashing out, whipped away the canvas shroud about the beak,\\nsuddenly revealing, as the bleached hull swung round towards the open ocean,\\ndeath for the figure-head, in a human skeleton; chalky comment on the chalked\\nwords below, “Follow your leader.”', 'At the sight, Don Benito, covering his face, wailed out: “’Tis he,\\nAranda! my murdered, unburied friend!”', 'Upon reaching the sealer, calling for ropes, Captain Delano bound the negro,\\nwho made no resistance, and had him hoisted to the deck. He would then have\\nassisted the now almost helpless Don Benito up the side; but Don Benito, wan as\\nhe was, refused to move, or be moved, until the negro should have been first\\nput below out of view. When, presently assured that it was done, he no more\\nshrank from the ascent.', 'The boat was immediately dispatched back to pick up the three swimming sailors.\\nMeantime, the guns were in readiness, though, owing to the San Dominick having\\nglided somewhat astern of the sealer, only the aftermost one could be brought\\nto bear. With this, they fired six times; thinking to cripple the fugitive ship\\nby bringing down her spars. But only a few inconsiderable ropes were shot away.\\nSoon the ship was beyond the gun’s range, steering broad out of the bay;\\nthe blacks thickly clustering round the bowsprit, one moment with taunting\\ncries towards the whites, the next with upthrown gestures hailing the now dusky\\nmoors of ocean—cawing crows escaped from the hand of the fowler.', 'The first impulse was to slip the cables and give chase. But, upon second\\nthoughts, to pursue with whale-boat and yawl seemed more promising.', 'Upon inquiring of Don Benito what firearms they had on board the San Dominick,\\nCaptain Delano was answered that they had none that could be used; because, in\\nthe earlier stages of the mutiny, a cabin-passenger, since dead, had secretly\\nput out of order the locks of what few muskets there were. But with all his\\nremaining strength, Don Benito entreated the American not to give chase, either\\nwith ship or boat; for the negroes had already proved themselves such\\ndesperadoes, that, in case of a present assault, nothing but a total massacre\\nof the whites could be looked for. But, regarding this warning as coming from\\none whose spirit had been crushed by misery the American did not give up his\\ndesign.', 'The boats were got ready and armed. Captain Delano ordered his men into them.\\nHe was going himself when Don Benito grasped his arm.', '“What! have you saved my life, Señor, and are you now going to throw away\\nyour own?”', 'The officers also, for reasons connected with their interests and those of the\\nvoyage, and a duty owing to the owners, strongly objected against their\\ncommander’s going. Weighing their remonstrances a moment, Captain Delano\\nfelt bound to remain; appointing his chief mate—an athletic and resolute\\nman, who had been a privateer’s-man—to head the party. The more to\\nencourage the sailors, they were told, that the Spanish captain considered his\\nship good as lost; that she and her cargo, including some gold and silver, were\\nworth more than a thousand doubloons. Take her, and no small part should be\\ntheirs. The sailors replied with a shout.', 'The fugitives had now almost gained an offing. It was nearly night; but the\\nmoon was rising. After hard, prolonged pulling, the boats came up on the\\nship’s quarters, at a suitable distance laying upon their oars to\\ndischarge their muskets. Having no bullets to return, the negroes sent their\\nyells. But, upon the second volley, Indian-like, they hurtled their hatchets.\\nOne took off a sailor’s fingers. Another struck the whale-boat’s\\nbow, cutting off the rope there, and remaining stuck in the gunwale like a\\nwoodman’s axe. Snatching it, quivering from its lodgment, the mate hurled\\nit back. The returned gauntlet now stuck in the ship’s broken\\nquarter-gallery, and so remained.', 'The negroes giving too hot a reception, the whites kept a more respectful\\ndistance. Hovering now just out of reach of the hurtling hatchets, they, with a\\nview to the close encounter which must soon come, sought to decoy the blacks\\ninto entirely disarming themselves of their most murderous weapons in a\\nhand-to-hand fight, by foolishly flinging them, as missiles, short of the mark,\\ninto the sea. But, ere long, perceiving the stratagem, the negroes desisted,\\nthough not before many of them had to replace their lost hatchets with\\nhandspikes; an exchange which, as counted upon, proved, in the end, favorable\\nto the assailants.', 'Meantime, with a strong wind, the ship still clove the water; the boats\\nalternately falling behind, and pulling up, to discharge fresh volleys.', 'The fire was mostly directed towards the stern, since there, chiefly, the\\nnegroes, at present, were clustering. But to kill or maim the negroes was not\\nthe object. To take them, with the ship, was the object. To do it, the ship\\nmust be boarded; which could not be done by boats while she was sailing so\\nfast.', 'A thought now struck the mate. Observing the Spanish boys still aloft, high as\\nthey could get, he called to them to descend to the yards, and cut adrift the\\nsails. It was done. About this time, owing to causes hereafter to be shown, two\\nSpaniards, in the dress of sailors, and conspicuously showing themselves, were\\nkilled; not by volleys, but by deliberate marksman’s shots; while, as it\\nafterwards appeared, by one of the general discharges, Atufal, the black, and\\nthe Spaniard at the helm likewise were killed. What now, with the loss of the\\nsails, and loss of leaders, the ship became unmanageable to the negroes.', 'With creaking masts, she came heavily round to the wind; the prow slowly\\nswinging into view of the boats, its skeleton gleaming in the horizontal\\nmoonlight, and casting a gigantic ribbed shadow upon the water. One extended\\narm of the ghost seemed beckoning the whites to avenge it.', '“Follow your leader!” cried the mate; and, one on each bow, the\\nboats boarded. Sealing-spears and cutlasses crossed hatchets and hand-spikes.\\nHuddled upon the long-boat amidships, the negresses raised a wailing chant,\\nwhose chorus was the clash of the steel.', 'For a time, the attack wavered; the negroes wedging themselves to beat it back;\\nthe half-repelled sailors, as yet unable to gain a footing, fighting as\\ntroopers in the saddle, one leg sideways flung over the bulwarks, and one\\nwithout, plying their cutlasses like carters’ whips. But in vain. They\\nwere almost overborne, when, rallying themselves into a squad as one man, with\\na huzza, they sprang inboard, where, entangled, they involuntarily separated\\nagain. For a few breaths’ space, there was a vague, muffled, inner sound,\\nas of submerged sword-fish rushing hither and thither through shoals of\\nblack-fish. Soon, in a reunited band, and joined by the Spanish seamen, the\\nwhites came to the surface, irresistibly driving the negroes toward the stern.\\nBut a barricade of casks and sacks, from side to side, had been thrown up by\\nthe main-mast. Here the negroes faced about, and though scorning peace or\\ntruce, yet fain would have had respite. But, without pause, overleaping the\\nbarrier, the unflagging sailors again closed. Exhausted, the blacks now fought\\nin despair. Their red tongues lolled, wolf-like, from their black mouths. But\\nthe pale sailors’ teeth were set; not a word was spoken; and, in five\\nminutes more, the ship was won.', 'Nearly a score of the negroes were killed. Exclusive of those by the balls,\\nmany were mangled; their wounds—mostly inflicted by the long-edged\\nsealing-spears, resembling those shaven ones of the English at Preston Pans,\\nmade by the poled scythes of the Highlanders. On the other side, none were\\nkilled, though several were wounded; some severely, including the mate. The\\nsurviving negroes were temporarily secured, and the ship, towed back into the\\nharbor at midnight, once more lay anchored.', 'Omitting the incidents and arrangements ensuing, suffice it that, after two\\ndays spent in refitting, the ships sailed in company for Conception, in Chili,\\nand thence for Lima, in Peru; where, before the vice-regal courts, the whole\\naffair, from the beginning, underwent investigation.', 'Though, midway on the passage, the ill-fated Spaniard, relaxed from constraint,\\nshowed some signs of regaining health with free-will; yet, agreeably to his own\\nforeboding, shortly before arriving at Lima, he relapsed, finally becoming so\\nreduced as to be carried ashore in arms. Hearing of his story and plight, one\\nof the many religious institutions of the City of Kings opened an hospitable\\nrefuge to him, where both physician and priest were his nurses, and a member of\\nthe order volunteered to be his one special guardian and consoler, by night and\\nby day.', 'The following extracts, translated from one of the official Spanish documents,\\nwill, it is hoped, shed light on the preceding narrative, as well as, in the\\nfirst place, reveal the true port of departure and true history of the San\\nDominick’s voyage, down to the time of her touching at the island of St.\\nMaria.', 'But, ere the extracts come, it may be well to preface them with a remark.', 'The document selected, from among many others, for partial translation,\\ncontains the deposition of Benito Cereno; the first taken in the case. Some\\ndisclosures therein were, at the time, held dubious for both learned and\\nnatural reasons. The tribunal inclined to the opinion that the deponent, not\\nundisturbed in his mind by recent events, raved of some things which could\\nnever have happened. But subsequent depositions of the surviving sailors,\\nbearing out the revelations of their captain in several of the strangest\\nparticulars, gave credence to the rest. So that the tribunal, in its final\\ndecision, rested its capital sentences upon statements which, had they lacked\\nconfirmation, it would have deemed it but duty to reject.', 'I, DON JOSE DE ABOS AND\\nPADILLA, His Majesty’s Notary for the Royal Revenue, and\\nRegister of this Province, and Notary Public of the Holy Crusade of this\\nBishopric, etc.', 'Do certify and declare, as much as is requisite in law, that, in the criminal\\ncause commenced the twenty-fourth of the month of September, in the year\\nseventeen hundred and ninety-nine, against the negroes of the ship San\\nDominick, the following declaration before me was made:', 'Declaration of the first witness, DON\\nBENITO CERENO.', 'The same day, and month, and year, His Honor, Doctor Juan Martinez de Rozas,\\nCouncilor of the Royal Audience of this Kingdom, and learned in the law of this\\nIntendency, ordered the captain of the ship San Dominick, Don Benito Cereno, to\\nappear; which he did, in his litter, attended by the monk Infelez; of whom he\\nreceived the oath, which he took by God, our Lord, and a sign of the Cross;\\nunder which he promised to tell the truth of whatever he should know and should\\nbe asked;—and being interrogated agreeably to the tenor of the act\\ncommencing the process, he said, that on the twentieth of May last, he set sail\\nwith his ship from the port of Valparaiso, bound to that of Callao; loaded with\\nthe produce of the country beside thirty cases of hardware and one hundred and\\nsixty blacks, of both sexes, mostly belonging to Don Alexandro Aranda,\\ngentleman, of the city of Mendoza; that the crew of the ship consisted of\\nthirty-six men, beside the persons who went as passengers; that the negroes\\nwere in part as follows:', '[Here, in the original, follows a list of some fifty names, descriptions,\\nand ages, compiled from certain recovered documents of Aranda’s, and also\\nfrom recollections of the deponent, from which portions only are\\nextracted.]', '—One, from about eighteen to nineteen years, named José, and this was the\\nman that waited upon his master, Don Alexandro, and who speaks well the\\nSpanish, having served him four or five years; * * * a mulatto, named\\nFrancesco, the cabin steward, of a good person and voice, having sung in the\\nValparaiso churches, native of the province of Buenos Ayres, aged about\\nthirty-five years. * * * A smart negro, named Dago, who had been for many years\\na grave-digger among the Spaniards, aged forty-six years. * * * Four old\\nnegroes, born in Africa, from sixty to seventy, but sound, calkers by trade,\\nwhose names are as follows:—the first was named Muri, and he was killed\\n(as was also his son named Diamelo); the second, Nacta; the third, Yola,\\nlikewise killed; the fourth, Ghofan; and six full-grown negroes, aged from\\nthirty to forty-five, all raw, and born among the Ashantees—Matiluqui,\\nYan, Leche, Mapenda, Yambaio, Akim; four of whom were killed; * * * a powerful\\nnegro named Atufal, who being supposed to have been a chief in Africa, his\\nowner set great store by him. * * * And a small negro of Senegal, but some\\nyears among the Spaniards, aged about thirty, which negro’s name was\\nBabo; * * * that he does not remember the names of the others, but that still\\nexpecting the residue of Don Alexandra’s papers will be found, will then\\ntake due account of them all, and remit to the court; * * * and thirty-nine\\nwomen and children of all ages.', '[The catalogue over, the deposition goes on]', '* * * That all the negroes slept upon deck, as is customary in this navigation,\\nand none wore fetters, because the owner, his friend Aranda, told him that they\\nwere all tractable; * * * that on the seventh day after leaving port, at three\\no’clock in the morning, all the Spaniards being asleep except the two\\nofficers on the watch, who were the boatswain, Juan Robles, and the carpenter,\\nJuan Bautista Gayete, and the helmsman and his boy, the negroes revolted\\nsuddenly, wounded dangerously the boatswain and the carpenter, and successively\\nkilled eighteen men of those who were sleeping upon deck, some with hand-spikes\\nand hatchets, and others by throwing them alive overboard, after tying them;\\nthat of the Spaniards upon deck, they left about seven, as he thinks, alive and\\ntied, to manoeuvre the ship, and three or four more, who hid themselves,\\nremained also alive. Although in the act of revolt the negroes made themselves\\nmasters of the hatchway, six or seven wounded went through it to the cockpit,\\nwithout any hindrance on their part; that during the act of revolt, the mate\\nand another person, whose name he does not recollect, attempted to come up\\nthrough the hatchway, but being quickly wounded, were obliged to return to the\\ncabin; that the deponent resolved at break of day to come up the companion-way,\\nwhere the negro Babo was, being the ringleader, and Atufal, who assisted him,\\nand having spoken to them, exhorted them to cease committing such atrocities,\\nasking them, at the same time, what they wanted and intended to do, offering,\\nhimself, to obey their commands; that notwithstanding this, they threw, in his\\npresence, three men, alive and tied, overboard; that they told the deponent to\\ncome up, and that they would not kill him; which having done, the negro Babo\\nasked him whether there were in those seas any negro countries where they might\\nbe carried, and he answered them, No; that the negro Babo afterwards told him\\nto carry them to Senegal, or to the neighboring islands of St. Nicholas; and he\\nanswered, that this was impossible, on account of the great distance, the\\nnecessity involved of rounding Cape Horn, the bad condition of the vessel, the\\nwant of provisions, sails, and water; but that the negro Babo replied to him he\\nmust carry them in any way; that they would do and conform themselves to\\neverything the deponent should require as to eating and drinking; that after a\\nlong conference, being absolutely compelled to please them, for they threatened\\nto kill all the whites if they were not, at all events, carried to Senegal, he\\ntold them that what was most wanting for the voyage was water; that they would\\ngo near the coast to take it, and thence they would proceed on their course;\\nthat the negro Babo agreed to it; and the deponent steered towards the\\nintermediate ports, hoping to meet some Spanish, or foreign vessel that would\\nsave them; that within ten or eleven days they saw the land, and continued\\ntheir course by it in the vicinity of Nasca; that the deponent observed that\\nthe negroes were now restless and mutinous, because he did not effect the\\ntaking in of water, the negro Babo having required, with threats, that it\\nshould be done, without fail, the following day; he told him he saw plainly\\nthat the coast was steep, and the rivers designated in the maps were not to be\\nfound, with other reasons suitable to the circumstances; that the best way\\nwould be to go to the island of Santa Maria, where they might water easily, it\\nbeing a solitary island, as the foreigners did; that the deponent did not go to\\nPisco, that was near, nor make any other port of the coast, because the negro\\nBabo had intimated to him several times, that he would kill all the whites the\\nvery moment he should perceive any city, town, or settlement of any kind on the\\nshores to which they should be carried: that having determined to go to the\\nisland of Santa Maria, as the deponent had planned, for the purpose of trying\\nwhether, on the passage or near the island itself, they could find any vessel\\nthat should favor them, or whether he could escape from it in a boat to the\\nneighboring coast of Arruco, to adopt the necessary means he immediately\\nchanged his course, steering for the island; that the negroes Babo and Atufal\\nheld daily conferences, in which they discussed what was necessary for their\\ndesign of returning to Senegal, whether they were to kill all the Spaniards,\\nand particularly the deponent; that eight days after parting from the coast of\\nNasca, the deponent being on the watch a little after day-break, and soon after\\nthe negroes had their meeting, the negro Babo came to the place where the\\ndeponent was, and told him that he had determined to kill his master, Don\\nAlexandro Aranda, both because he and his companions could not otherwise be\\nsure of their liberty, and that to keep the seamen in subjection, he wanted to\\nprepare a warning of what road they should be made to take did they or any of\\nthem oppose him; and that, by means of the death of Don Alexandro, that warning\\nwould best be given; but, that what this last meant, the deponent did not at\\nthe time comprehend, nor could not, further than that the death of Don\\nAlexandro was intended; and moreover the negro Babo proposed to the deponent to\\ncall the mate Raneds, who was sleeping in the cabin, before the thing was done,\\nfor fear, as the deponent understood it, that the mate, who was a good\\nnavigator, should be killed with Don Alexandro and the rest; that the deponent,\\nwho was the friend, from youth, of Don Alexandro, prayed and conjured, but all\\nwas useless; for the negro Babo answered him that the thing could not be\\nprevented, and that all the Spaniards risked their death if they should attempt\\nto frustrate his will in this matter, or any other; that, in this conflict, the\\ndeponent called the mate, Raneds, who was forced to go apart, and immediately\\nthe negro Babo commanded the Ashantee Martinqui and the Ashantee Lecbe to go\\nand commit the murder; that those two went down with hatchets to the berth of\\nDon Alexandro; that, yet half alive and mangled, they dragged him on deck; that\\nthey were going to throw him overboard in that state, but the negro Babo\\nstopped them, bidding the murder be completed on the deck before him, which was\\ndone, when, by his orders, the body was carried below, forward; that nothing\\nmore was seen of it by the deponent for three days; * * * that Don Alonzo\\nSidonia, an old man, long resident at Valparaiso, and lately appointed to a\\ncivil office in Peru, whither he had taken passage, was at the time sleeping in\\nthe berth opposite Don Alexandro’s; that awakening at his cries,\\nsurprised by them, and at the sight of the negroes with their bloody hatchets\\nin their hands, he threw himself into the sea through a window which was near\\nhim, and was drowned, without it being in the power of the deponent to assist\\nor take him up; * * * that a short time after killing Aranda, they brought upon\\ndeck his german-cousin, of middle-age, Don Francisco Masa, of Mendoza, and the\\nyoung Don Joaquin, Marques de Aramboalaza, then lately from Spain, with his\\nSpanish servant Ponce, and the three young clerks of Aranda, José Mozairi\\nLorenzo Bargas, and Hermenegildo Gandix, all of Cadiz; that Don Joaquin and\\nHermenegildo Gandix, the negro Babo, for purposes hereafter to appear,\\npreserved alive; but Don Francisco Masa, José Mozairi, and Lorenzo Bargas, with\\nPonce the servant, beside the boatswain, Juan Robles, the boatswain’s\\nmates, Manuel Viscaya and Roderigo Hurta, and four of the sailors, the negro\\nBabo ordered to be thrown alive into the sea, although they made no resistance,\\nnor begged for anything else but mercy; that the boatswain, Juan Robles, who\\nknew how to swim, kept the longest above water, making acts of contrition, and,\\nin the last words he uttered, charged this deponent to cause mass to be said\\nfor his soul to our Lady of Succor: * * * that, during the three days which\\nfollowed, the deponent, uncertain what fate had befallen the remains of Don\\nAlexandro, frequently asked the negro Babo where they were, and, if still on\\nboard, whether they were to be preserved for interment ashore, entreating him\\nso to order it; that the negro Babo answered nothing till the fourth day, when\\nat sunrise, the deponent coming on deck, the negro Babo showed him a skeleton,\\nwhich had been substituted for the ship’s proper figure-head—the\\nimage of Christopher Colon, the discoverer of the New World; that the negro\\nBabo asked him whose skeleton that was, and whether, from its whiteness, he\\nshould not think it a white’s; that, upon discovering his face, the negro\\nBabo, coming close, said words to this effect: “Keep faith with the\\nblacks from here to Senegal, or you shall in spirit, as now in body, follow\\nyour leader,” pointing to the prow; * * * that the same morning the negro\\nBabo took by succession each Spaniard forward, and asked him whose skeleton\\nthat was, and whether, from its whiteness, he should not think it a\\nwhite’s; that each Spaniard covered his face; that then to each the negro\\nBabo repeated the words in the first place said to the deponent; * * * that\\nthey (the Spaniards), being then assembled aft, the negro Babo harangued them,\\nsaying that he had now done all; that the deponent (as navigator for the\\nnegroes) might pursue his course, warning him and all of them that they should,\\nsoul and body, go the way of Don Alexandro, if he saw them (the Spaniards)\\nspeak, or plot anything against them (the negroes)—a threat which was\\nrepeated every day; that, before the events last mentioned, they had tied the\\ncook to throw him overboard, for it is not known what thing they heard him\\nspeak, but finally the negro Babo spared his life, at the request of the\\ndeponent; that a few days after, the deponent, endeavoring not to omit any\\nmeans to preserve the lives of the remaining whites, spoke to the negroes peace\\nand tranquillity, and agreed to draw up a paper, signed by the deponent and the\\nsailors who could write, as also by the negro Babo, for himself and all the\\nblacks, in which the deponent obliged himself to carry them to Senegal, and\\nthey not to kill any more, and he formally to make over to them the ship, with\\nthe cargo, with which they were for that time satisfied and quieted. * * But\\nthe next day, the more surely to guard against the sailors’ escape, the\\nnegro Babo commanded all the boats to be destroyed but the long-boat, which was\\nunseaworthy, and another, a cutter in good condition, which knowing it would\\nyet be wanted for towing the water casks, he had it lowered down into the hold.', '[Various particulars of the prolonged and perplexed navigation ensuing here\\nfollow, with incidents of a calamitous calm, from which portion one passage is\\nextracted, to wit:]', '—That on the fifth day of the calm, all on board suffering much from the\\nheat, and want of water, and five having died in fits, and mad, the negroes\\nbecame irritable, and for a chance gesture, which they deemed\\nsuspicious—though it was harmless—made by the mate, Raneds, to the\\ndeponent in the act of handing a quadrant, they killed him; but that for this\\nthey afterwards were sorry, the mate being the only remaining navigator on\\nboard, except the deponent.', '—That omitting other events, which daily happened, and which can only\\nserve uselessly to recall past misfortunes and conflicts, after seventy-three\\ndays’ navigation, reckoned from the time they sailed from Nasca, during\\nwhich they navigated under a scanty allowance of water, and were afflicted with\\nthe calms before mentioned, they at last arrived at the island of Santa Maria,\\non the seventeenth of the month of August, at about six o’clock in the\\nafternoon, at which hour they cast anchor very near the American ship,\\nBachelor’s Delight, which lay in the same bay, commanded by the generous\\nCaptain Amasa Delano; but at six o’clock in the morning, they had already\\ndescried the port, and the negroes became uneasy, as soon as at distance they\\nsaw the ship, not having expected to see one there; that the negro Babo\\npacified them, assuring them that no fear need be had; that straightway he\\nordered the figure on the bow to be covered with canvas, as for repairs and had\\nthe decks a little set in order; that for a time the negro Babo and the negro\\nAtufal conferred; that the negro Atufal was for sailing away, but the negro\\nBabo would not, and, by himself, cast about what to do; that at last he came to\\nthe deponent, proposing to him to say and do all that the deponent declares to\\nhave said and done to the American captain; * * * * * * * that the negro Babo\\nwarned him that if he varied in the least, or uttered any word, or gave any\\nlook that should give the least intimation of the past events or present state,\\nhe would instantly kill him, with all his companions, showing a dagger, which\\nhe carried hid, saying something which, as he understood it, meant that that\\ndagger would be alert as his eye; that the negro Babo then announced the plan\\nto all his companions, which pleased them; that he then, the better to disguise\\nthe truth, devised many expedients, in some of them uniting deceit and defense;\\nthat of this sort was the device of the six Ashantees before named, who were\\nhis bravoes; that them he stationed on the break of the poop, as if to clean\\ncertain hatchets (in cases, which were part of the cargo), but in reality to\\nuse them, and distribute them at need, and at a given word he told them; that,\\namong other devices, was the device of presenting Atufal, his right hand man,\\nas chained, though in a moment the chains could be dropped; that in every\\nparticular he informed the deponent what part he was expected to enact in every\\ndevice, and what story he was to tell on every occasion, always threatening him\\nwith instant death if he varied in the least: that, conscious that many of the\\nnegroes would be turbulent, the negro Babo appointed the four aged negroes, who\\nwere calkers, to keep what domestic order they could on the decks; that again\\nand again he harangued the Spaniards and his companions, informing them of his\\nintent, and of his devices, and of the invented story that this deponent was to\\ntell; charging them lest any of them varied from that story; that these\\narrangements were made and matured during the interval of two or three hours,\\nbetween their first sighting the ship and the arrival on board of Captain Amasa\\nDelano; that this happened about half-past seven o’clock in the morning,\\nCaptain Amasa Delano coming in his boat, and all gladly receiving him; that the\\ndeponent, as well as he could force himself, acting then the part of principal\\nowner, and a free captain of the ship, told Captain Amasa Delano, when called\\nupon, that he came from Buenos Ayres, bound to Lima, with three hundred\\nnegroes; that off Cape Horn, and in a subsequent fever, many negroes had died;\\nthat also, by similar casualties, all the sea officers and the greatest part of\\nthe crew had died.', '[And so the deposition goes on, circumstantially recounting the fictitious\\nstory dictated to the deponent by Babo, and through the deponent imposed upon\\nCaptain Delano; and also recounting the friendly offers of Captain Delano, with\\nother things, but all of which is here omitted. After the fictitious story,\\netc. the deposition proceeds:]', '—that the generous Captain Amasa Delano remained on board all the day,\\ntill he left the ship anchored at six o’clock in the evening, deponent\\nspeaking to him always of his pretended misfortunes, under the fore-mentioned\\nprinciples, without having had it in his power to tell a single word, or give\\nhim the least hint, that he might know the truth and state of things; because\\nthe negro Babo, performing the office of an officious servant with all the\\nappearance of submission of the humble slave, did not leave the deponent one\\nmoment; that this was in order to observe the deponent’s actions and\\nwords, for the negro Babo understands well the Spanish; and besides, there were\\nthereabout some others who were constantly on the watch, and likewise\\nunderstood the Spanish; * * * that upon one occasion, while deponent was\\nstanding on the deck conversing with Amasa Delano, by a secret sign the negro\\nBabo drew him (the deponent) aside, the act appearing as if originating with\\nthe deponent; that then, he being drawn aside, the negro Babo proposed to him\\nto gain from Amasa Delano full particulars about his ship, and crew, and arms;\\nthat the deponent asked “For what?” that the negro Babo answered he\\nmight conceive; that, grieved at the prospect of what might overtake the\\ngenerous Captain Amasa Delano, the deponent at first refused to ask the desired\\nquestions, and used every argument to induce the negro Babo to give up this new\\ndesign; that the negro Babo showed the point of his dagger; that, after the\\ninformation had been obtained the negro Babo again drew him aside, telling him\\nthat that very night he (the deponent) would be captain of two ships, instead\\nof one, for that, great part of the American’s ship’s crew being to\\nbe absent fishing, the six Ashantees, without any one else, would easily take\\nit; that at this time he said other things to the same purpose; that no\\nentreaties availed; that, before Amasa Delano’s coming on board, no hint\\nhad been given touching the capture of the American ship: that to prevent this\\nproject the deponent was powerless; * * *—that in some things his memory\\nis confused, he cannot distinctly recall every event; * * *—that as soon\\nas they had cast anchor at six of the clock in the evening, as has before been\\nstated, the American Captain took leave, to return to his vessel; that upon a\\nsudden impulse, which the deponent believes to have come from God and his\\nangels, he, after the farewell had been said, followed the generous Captain\\nAmasa Delano as far as the gunwale, where he stayed, under pretense of taking\\nleave, until Amasa Delano should have been seated in his boat; that on shoving\\noff, the deponent sprang from the gunwale into the boat, and fell into it, he\\nknows not how, God guarding him; that—', '[Here, in the original, follows the account of what further happened at the\\nescape, and how the San Dominick was retaken, and of the passage to the coast;\\nincluding in the recital many expressions of “eternal gratitude” to\\nthe “generous Captain Amasa Delano.” The deposition then proceeds\\nwith recapitulatory remarks, and a partial renumeration of the negroes, making\\nrecord of their individual part in the past events, with a view to furnishing,\\naccording to command of the court, the data whereon to found the criminal\\nsentences to be pronounced. From this portion is the following;]', '—That he believes that all the negroes, though not in the first place\\nknowing to the design of revolt, when it was accomplished, approved it. * * *\\nThat the negro, José, eighteen years old, and in the personal service of Don\\nAlexandro, was the one who communicated the information to the negro Babo,\\nabout the state of things in the cabin, before the revolt; that this is known,\\nbecause, in the preceding midnight, he use to come from his berth, which was\\nunder his master’s, in the cabin, to the deck where the ringleader and\\nhis associates were, and had secret conversations with the negro Babo, in which\\nhe was several times seen by the mate; that, one night, the mate drove him away\\ntwice; * * that this same negro José was the one who, without being commanded\\nto do so by the negro Babo, as Lecbe and Martinqui were, stabbed his master,\\nDon Alexandro, after he had been dragged half-lifeless to the deck; * * that\\nthe mulatto steward, Francesco, was of the first band of revolters, that he\\nwas, in all things, the creature and tool of the negro Babo; that, to make his\\ncourt, he, just before a repast in the cabin, proposed, to the negro Babo,\\npoisoning a dish for the generous Captain Amasa Delano; this is known and\\nbelieved, because the negroes have said it; but that the negro Babo, having\\nanother design, forbade Francesco; * * that the Ashantee Lecbe was one of the\\nworst of them; for that, on the day the ship was retaken, he assisted in the\\ndefense of her, with a hatchet in each hand, with one of which he wounded, in\\nthe breast, the chief mate of Amasa Delano, in the first act of boarding; this\\nall knew; that, in sight of the deponent, Lecbe struck, with a hatchet, Don\\nFrancisco Masa, when, by the negro Babo’s orders, he was carrying him to\\nthrow him overboard, alive, beside participating in the murder, before\\nmentioned, of Don Alexandro Aranda, and others of the cabin-passengers; that,\\nowing to the fury with which the Ashantees fought in the engagement with the\\nboats, but this Lecbe and Yan survived; that Yan was bad as Lecbe; that Yan was\\nthe man who, by Babo’s command, willingly prepared the skeleton of Don\\nAlexandro, in a way the negroes afterwards told the deponent, but which he, so\\nlong as reason is left him, can never divulge; that Yan and Lecbe were the two\\nwho, in a calm by night, riveted the skeleton to the bow; this also the negroes\\ntold him; that the negro Babo was he who traced the inscription below it; that\\nthe negro Babo was the plotter from first to last; he ordered every murder, and\\nwas the helm and keel of the revolt; that Atufal was his lieutenant in all; but\\nAtufal, with his own hand, committed no murder; nor did the negro Babo; * *\\nthat Atufal was shot, being killed in the fight with the boats, ere boarding; *\\n* that the negresses, of age, were knowing to the revolt, and testified\\nthemselves satisfied at the death of their master, Don Alexandro; that, had the\\nnegroes not restrained them, they would have tortured to death, instead of\\nsimply killing, the Spaniards slain by command of the negro Babo; that the\\nnegresses used their utmost influence to have the deponent made away with;\\nthat, in the various acts of murder, they sang songs and danced—not\\ngaily, but solemnly; and before the engagement with the boats, as well as\\nduring the action, they sang melancholy songs to the negroes, and that this\\nmelancholy tone was more inflaming than a different one would have been, and\\nwas so intended; that all this is believed, because the negroes have said\\nit.—that of the thirty-six men of the crew, exclusive of the passengers\\n(all of whom are now dead), which the deponent had knowledge of, six only\\nremained alive, with four cabin-boys and ship-boys, not included with the crew;\\n* *—that the negroes broke an arm of one of the cabin-boys and gave him\\nstrokes with hatchets.', '[Then follow various random disclosures referring to various periods of\\ntime. The following are extracted;]', '—That during the presence of Captain Amasa Delano on board, some attempts\\nwere made by the sailors, and one by Hermenegildo Gandix, to convey hints to\\nhim of the true state of affairs; but that these attempts were ineffectual,\\nowing to fear of incurring death, and, futhermore, owing to the devices which\\noffered contradictions to the true state of affairs, as well as owing to the\\ngenerosity and piety of Amasa Delano incapable of sounding such wickedness; * *\\n* that Luys Galgo, a sailor about sixty years of age, and formerly of the\\nking’s navy, was one of those who sought to convey tokens to Captain\\nAmasa Delano; but his intent, though undiscovered, being suspected, he was, on\\na pretense, made to retire out of sight, and at last into the hold, and there\\nwas made away with. This the negroes have since said; * * * that one of the\\nship-boys feeling, from Captain Amasa Delano’s presence, some hopes of\\nrelease, and not having enough prudence, dropped some chance-word respecting\\nhis expectations, which being overheard and understood by a slave-boy with whom\\nhe was eating at the time, the latter struck him on the head with a knife,\\ninflicting a bad wound, but of which the boy is now healing; that likewise, not\\nlong before the ship was brought to anchor, one of the seamen, steering at the\\ntime, endangered himself by letting the blacks remark some expression in his\\ncountenance, arising from a cause similar to the above; but this sailor, by his\\nheedful after conduct, escaped; * * * that these statements are made to show\\nthe court that from the beginning to the end of the revolt, it was impossible\\nfor the deponent and his men to act otherwise than they did; * * *—that\\nthe third clerk, Hermenegildo Gandix, who before had been forced to live among\\nthe seamen, wearing a seaman’s habit, and in all respects appearing to be\\none for the time; he, Gandix, was killed by a musket ball fired through mistake\\nfrom the boats before boarding; having in his fright run up the mizzen-rigging,\\ncalling to the boats—“don’t board,” lest upon their\\nboarding the negroes should kill him; that this inducing the Americans to\\nbelieve he some way favored the cause of the negroes, they fired two balls at\\nhim, so that he fell wounded from the rigging, and was drowned in the sea; * *\\n*—that the young Don Joaquin, Marques de Aramboalaza, like Hermenegildo\\nGandix, the third clerk, was degraded to the office and appearance of a common\\nseaman; that upon one occasion when Don Joaquin shrank, the negro Babo\\ncommanded the Ashantee Lecbe to take tar and heat it, and pour it upon Don\\nJoaquin’s hands; * * *—that Don Joaquin was killed owing to another\\nmistake of the Americans, but one impossible to be avoided, as upon the\\napproach of the boats, Don Joaquin, with a hatchet tied edge out and upright to\\nhis hand, was made by the negroes to appear on the bulwarks; whereupon, seen\\nwith arms in his hands and in a questionable attitude, he was shot for a\\nrenegade seaman; * * *—that on the person of Don Joaquin was found\\nsecreted a jewel, which, by papers that were discovered, proved to have been\\nmeant for the shrine of our Lady of Mercy in Lima; a votive offering,\\nbeforehand prepared and guarded, to attest his gratitude, when he should have\\nlanded in Peru, his last destination, for the safe conclusion of his entire\\nvoyage from Spain; * * *—that the jewel, with the other effects of the\\nlate Don Joaquin, is in the custody of the brethren of the Hospital de\\nSacerdotes, awaiting the disposition of the honorable court; * * *—that,\\nowing to the condition of the deponent, as well as the haste in which the boats\\ndeparted for the attack, the Americans were not forewarned that there were,\\namong the apparent crew, a passenger and one of the clerks disguised by the\\nnegro Babo; * * *—that, beside the negroes killed in the action, some\\nwere killed after the capture and re-anchoring at night, when shackled to the\\nring-bolts on deck; that these deaths were committed by the sailors, ere they\\ncould be prevented. That so soon as informed of it, Captain Amasa Delano used\\nall his authority, and, in particular with his own hand, struck down Martinez\\nGola, who, having found a razor in the pocket of an old jacket of his, which\\none of the shackled negroes had on, was aiming it at the negro’s throat;\\nthat the noble Captain Amasa Delano also wrenched from the hand of Bartholomew\\nBarlo a dagger, secreted at the time of the massacre of the whites, with which\\nhe was in the act of stabbing a shackled negro, who, the same day, with another\\nnegro, had thrown him down and jumped upon him; * * *—that, for all the\\nevents, befalling through so long a time, during which the ship was in the\\nhands of the negro Babo, he cannot here give account; but that, what he has\\nsaid is the most substantial of what occurs to him at present, and is the truth\\nunder the oath which he has taken; which declaration he affirmed and ratified,\\nafter hearing it read to him.', 'He said that he is twenty-nine years of age, and broken in body and mind; that\\nwhen finally dismissed by the court, he shall not return home to Chili, but\\nbetake himself to the monastery on Mount Agonia without; and signed with his\\nhonor, and crossed himself, and, for the time, departed as he came, in his\\nlitter, with the monk Infelez, to the Hospital de Sacerdotes.', 'BENITO CERENO.', 'DOCTOR ROZAS.', 'If the Deposition have served as the key to fit into the lock of the\\ncomplications which precede it, then, as a vault whose door has been flung\\nback, the San Dominick’s hull lies open to-day.', 'Hitherto the nature of this narrative, besides rendering the intricacies in the\\nbeginning unavoidable, has more or less required that many things, instead of\\nbeing set down in the order of occurrence, should be retrospectively, or\\nirregularly given; this last is the case with the following passages, which\\nwill conclude the account:', 'During the long, mild voyage to Lima, there was, as before hinted, a period\\nduring which the sufferer a little recovered his health, or, at least in some\\ndegree, his tranquillity. Ere the decided relapse which came, the two captains\\nhad many cordial conversations—their fraternal unreserve in singular\\ncontrast with former withdrawments.', 'Again and again it was repeated, how hard it had been to enact the part forced\\non the Spaniard by Babo.', '“Ah, my dear friend,” Don Benito once said, “at those very\\ntimes when you thought me so morose and ungrateful, nay, when, as you now\\nadmit, you half thought me plotting your murder, at those very times my heart\\nwas frozen; I could not look at you, thinking of what, both on board this ship\\nand your own, hung, from other hands, over my kind benefactor. And as God\\nlives, Don Amasa, I know not whether desire for my own safety alone could have\\nnerved me to that leap into your boat, had it not been for the thought that,\\ndid you, unenlightened, return to your ship, you, my best friend, with all who\\nmight be with you, stolen upon, that night, in your hammocks, would never in\\nthis world have wakened again. Do but think how you walked this deck, how you\\nsat in this cabin, every inch of ground mined into honey-combs under you. Had I\\ndropped the least hint, made the least advance towards an understanding between\\nus, death, explosive death—yours as mine—would have ended the\\nscene.”', '“True, true,” cried Captain Delano, starting, “you have saved\\nmy life, Don Benito, more than I yours; saved it, too, against my knowledge and\\nwill.”', '“Nay, my friend,” rejoined the Spaniard, courteous even to the\\npoint of religion, “God charmed your life, but you saved mine. To think\\nof some things you did—those smilings and chattings, rash pointings and\\ngesturings. For less than these, they slew my mate, Raneds; but you had the\\nPrince of Heaven’s safe-conduct through all ambuscades.”', '“Yes, all is owing to Providence, I know: but the temper of my mind that\\nmorning was more than commonly pleasant, while the sight of so much suffering,\\nmore apparent than real, added to my good-nature, compassion, and charity,\\nhappily interweaving the three. Had it been otherwise, doubtless, as you hint,\\nsome of my interferences might have ended unhappily enough. Besides, those\\nfeelings I spoke of enabled me to get the better of momentary distrust, at\\ntimes when acuteness might have cost me my life, without saving\\nanother’s. Only at the end did my suspicions get the better of me, and\\nyou know how wide of the mark they then proved.”', '“Wide, indeed,” said Don Benito, sadly; “you were with me all\\nday; stood with me, sat with me, talked with me, looked at me, ate with me,\\ndrank with me; and yet, your last act was to clutch for a monster, not only an\\ninnocent man, but the most pitiable of all men. To such degree may malign\\nmachinations and deceptions impose. So far may even the best man err, in\\njudging the conduct of one with the recesses of whose condition he is not\\nacquainted. But you were forced to it; and you were in time undeceived. Would\\nthat, in both respects, it was so ever, and with all men.”', '“You generalize, Don Benito; and mournfully enough. But the past is\\npassed; why moralize upon it? Forget it. See, yon bright sun has forgotten it\\nall, and the blue sea, and the blue sky; these have turned over new\\nleaves.”', '“Because they have no memory,” he dejectedly replied;\\n“because they are not human.”', '“But these mild trades that now fan your cheek, do they not come with a\\nhuman-like healing to you? Warm friends, steadfast friends are the\\ntrades.”', '“With their steadfastness they but waft me to my tomb, Señor,” was\\nthe foreboding response.', '“You are saved,” cried Captain Delano, more and more astonished and\\npained; “you are saved: what has cast such a shadow upon you?”', '“The negro.”', 'There was silence, while the moody man sat, slowly and unconsciously gathering\\nhis mantle about him, as if it were a pall.', 'There was no more conversation that day.', 'But if the Spaniard’s melancholy sometimes ended in muteness upon topics\\nlike the above, there were others upon which he never spoke at all; on which,\\nindeed, all his old reserves were piled. Pass over the worst, and, only to\\nelucidate let an item or two of these be cited. The dress, so precise and\\ncostly, worn by him on the day whose events have been narrated, had not\\nwillingly been put on. And that silver-mounted sword, apparent symbol of\\ndespotic command, was not, indeed, a sword, but the ghost of one. The scabbard,\\nartificially stiffened, was empty.', 'As for the black—whose brain, not body, had schemed and led the revolt,\\nwith the plot—his slight frame, inadequate to that which it held, had at\\nonce yielded to the superior muscular strength of his captor, in the boat.\\nSeeing all was over, he uttered no sound, and could not be forced to. His\\naspect seemed to say, since I cannot do deeds, I will not speak words. Put in\\nirons in the hold, with the rest, he was carried to Lima. During the passage,\\nDon Benito did not visit him. Nor then, nor at any time after, would he look at\\nhim. Before the tribunal he refused. When pressed by the judges he fainted. On\\nthe testimony of the sailors alone rested the legal identity of Babo.', 'Some months after, dragged to the gibbet at the tail of a mule, the black met\\nhis voiceless end. The body was burned to ashes; but for many days, the head,\\nthat hive of subtlety, fixed on a pole in the Plaza, met, unabashed, the gaze\\nof the whites; and across the Plaza looked towards St. Bartholomew’s\\nchurch, in whose vaults slept then, as now, the recovered bones of Aranda: and\\nacross the Rimac bridge looked towards the monastery, on Mount Agonia without;\\nwhere, three months after being dismissed by the court, Benito Cereno, borne on\\nthe bier, did, indeed, follow his leader.', 'What grand irregular thunder, thought I, standing on my hearth-stone among the\\nAcroceraunian hills, as the scattered bolts boomed overhead, and crashed down\\namong the valleys, every bolt followed by zigzag irradiations, and swift slants\\nof sharp rain, which audibly rang, like a charge of spear-points, on my low\\nshingled roof. I suppose, though, that the mountains hereabouts break and churn\\nup the thunder, so that it is far more glorious here than on the plain.\\nHark!—someone at the door. Who is this that chooses a time of thunder for\\nmaking calls? And why don’t he, man-fashion, use the knocker, instead of\\nmaking that doleful undertaker’s clatter with his fist against the hollow\\npanel? But let him in. Ah, here he comes. “Good day, sir:” an\\nentire stranger. “Pray be seated.” What is that strange-looking\\nwalking-stick he carries: “A fine thunder-storm, sir.”', '“Fine?—Awful!”', '“You are wet. Stand here on the hearth before the fire.”', '“Not for worlds!”', 'The stranger still stood in the exact middle of the cottage, where he had first\\nplanted himself. His singularity impelled a closer scrutiny. A lean, gloomy\\nfigure. Hair dark and lank, mattedly streaked over his brow. His sunken\\npitfalls of eyes were ringed by indigo halos, and played with an innocuous sort\\nof lightning: the gleam without the bolt. The whole man was dripping. He stood\\nin a puddle on the bare oak floor: his strange walking-stick vertically resting\\nat his side.', 'It was a polished copper rod, four feet long, lengthwise attached to a neat\\nwooden staff, by insertion into two balls of greenish glass, ringed with copper\\nbands. The metal rod terminated at the top tripodwise, in three keen tines,\\nbrightly gilt. He held the thing by the wooden part alone.', '“Sir,” said I, bowing politely, “have I the honor of a visit\\nfrom that illustrious god, Jupiter Tonans? So stood he in the Greek statue of\\nold, grasping the lightning-bolt. If you be he, or his viceroy, I have to thank\\nyou for this noble storm you have brewed among our mountains. Listen: That was\\na glorious peal. Ah, to a lover of the majestic, it is a good thing to have the\\nThunderer himself in one’s cottage. The thunder grows finer for that. But\\npray be seated. This old rush-bottomed arm-chair, I grant, is a poor substitute\\nfor your evergreen throne on Olympus; but, condescend to be seated.”', 'While I thus pleasantly spoke, the stranger eyed me, half in wonder, and half\\nin a strange sort of horror; but did not move a foot.', '“Do, sir, be seated; you need to be dried ere going forth again.”', 'I planted the chair invitingly on the broad hearth, where a little fire had\\nbeen kindled that afternoon to dissipate the dampness, not the cold; for it was\\nearly in the month of September.', 'But without heeding my solicitation, and still standing in the middle of the\\nfloor, the stranger gazed at me portentously and spoke.', '“Sir,” said he, “excuse me; but instead of my accepting your\\ninvitation to be seated on the hearth there, I solemnly warn you, that\\nyou had best accept mine, and stand with me in the middle of the room.\\nGood heavens!” he cried, starting—“there is another of those\\nawful crashes. I warn you, sir, quit the hearth.”', '“Mr. Jupiter Tonans,” said I, quietly rolling my body on the stone,\\n“I stand very well here.”', '“Are you so horridly ignorant, then,” he cried, “as not to\\nknow, that by far the most dangerous part of a house, during such a terrific\\ntempest as this, is the fire-place?”', '“Nay, I did not know that,” involuntarily stepping upon the first\\nboard next to the stone.', 'The stranger now assumed such an unpleasant air of successful admonition,\\nthat—quite involuntarily again—I stepped back upon the hearth, and\\nthrew myself into the erectest, proudest posture I could command. But I said\\nnothing.', '“For Heaven’s sake,” he cried, with a strange mixture of\\nalarm and intimidation—“for Heaven’s sake, get off the\\nhearth! Know you not, that the heated air and soot are conductors;—to say\\nnothing of those immense iron fire-dogs? Quit the spot—I conjure—I\\ncommand you.”', '“Mr. Jupiter Tonans, I am not accustomed to be commanded in my own\\nhouse.”', '“Call me not by that pagan name. You are profane in this time of\\nterror.”', '“Sir, will you be so good as to tell me your business? If you seek\\nshelter from the storm, you are welcome, so long as you be civil; but if you\\ncome on business, open it forthwith. Who are you?”', '“I am a dealer in lightning-rods,” said the stranger, softening his\\ntone; “my special business is—Merciful heaven! what a\\ncrash!—Have you ever been struck—your premises, I mean? No?\\nIt’s best to be provided;”—significantly rattling his\\nmetallic staff on the floor;—“by nature, there are no castles in\\nthunder-storms; yet, say but the word, and of this cottage I can make a\\nGibraltar by a few waves of this wand. Hark, what Himalayas of\\nconcussions!”', '“You interrupted yourself; your special business you were about to speak\\nof.”', '“My special business is to travel the country for orders for\\nlightning-rods. This is my specimen-rod;” tapping his staff; “I\\nhave the best of references”—fumbling in his pockets. “In\\nCriggan last month, I put up three-and-twenty rods on only five\\nbuildings.”', '“Let me see. Was it not at Criggan last week, about midnight on Saturday,\\nthat the steeple, the big elm, and the assembly-room cupola were struck? Any of\\nyour rods there?”', '“Not on the tree and cupola, but the steeple.”', '“Of what use is your rod, then?”', '“Of life-and-death use. But my workman was heedless. In fitting the rod\\nat top to the steeple, he allowed a part of the metal to graze the tin\\nsheeting. Hence the accident. Not my fault, but his. Hark!”', '“Never mind. That clap burst quite loud enough to be heard without\\nfinger-pointing. Did you hear of the event at Montreal last year? A servant\\ngirl struck at her bed-side with a rosary in her hand; the beads being metal.\\nDoes your beat extend into the Canadas?”', '“No. And I hear that there, iron rods only are in use. They should have\\nmine, which are copper. Iron is easily fused. Then they draw out the rod\\nso slender, that it has not body enough to conduct the full electric current.\\nThe metal melts; the building is destroyed. My copper rods never act so. Those\\nCanadians are fools. Some of them knob the rod at the top, which risks a deadly\\nexplosion, instead of imperceptibly carrying down the current into the earth,\\nas this sort of rod does. Mine is the only true rod. Look at it. Only\\none dollar a foot.”', '“This abuse of your own calling in another might make one distrustful\\nwith respect to yourself.”', '“Hark! The thunder becomes less muttering. It is nearing us, and nearing\\nthe earth, too. Hark! One crammed crash! All the vibrations made one by\\nnearness. Another flash. Hold!”', '“What do you?” I said, seeing him now, instantaneously\\nrelinquishing his staff, lean intently forward towards the window, with his\\nright fore and middle fingers on his left wrist. But ere the words had well\\nescaped me, another exclamation escaped him.', '“Crash! only three pulses—less than a third of a mile\\noff—yonder, somewhere in that wood. I passed three stricken oaks there,\\nripped out new and glittering. The oak draws lightning more than other timber,\\nhaving iron in solution in its sap. Your floor here seems oak.', '“Heart-of-oak. From the peculiar time of your call upon me, I suppose you\\npurposely select stormy weather for your journeys. When the thunder is roaring,\\nyou deem it an hour peculiarly favorable for producing impressions favorable to\\nyour trade.”', '“Hark!—Awful!”', '“For one who would arm others with fear you seem unbeseemingly timorous\\nyourself. Common men choose fair weather for their travels: you choose\\nthunder-storms; and yet—”', '“That I travel in thunder-storms, I grant; but not without particular\\nprecautions, such as only a lightning-rod man may know. Hark! Quick—look\\nat my specimen rod. Only one dollar a foot.”', '“A very fine rod, I dare say. But what are these particular precautions\\nof yours? Yet first let me close yonder shutters; the slanting rain is beating\\nthrough the sash. I will bar up.”', '“Are you mad? Know you not that yon iron bar is a swift conductor?\\nDesist.”', '“I will simply close the shutters, then, and call my boy to bring me a\\nwooden bar. Pray, touch the bell-pull there.', '“Are you frantic? That bell-wire might blast you. Never touch bell-wire\\nin a thunder-storm, nor ring a bell of any sort.”', '“Nor those in belfries? Pray, will you tell me where and how one may be\\nsafe in a time like this? Is there any part of my house I may touch with hopes\\nof my life?”', '“There is; but not where you now stand. Come away from the wall. The\\ncurrent will sometimes run down a wall, and—a man being a better\\nconductor than a wall—it would leave the wall and run into him. Swoop!\\nThat must have fallen very nigh. That must have been globular\\nlightning.”', '“Very probably. Tell me at once, which is, in your opinion, the safest\\npart of this house?', '“This room, and this one spot in it where I stand. Come hither.”', '“The reasons first.”', '“Hark!—after the flash the gust—the sashes shiver—the\\nhouse, the house!—Come hither to me!”', '“The reasons, if you please.”', '“Come hither to me!”', '“Thank you again, I think I will try my old stand—the hearth. And\\nnow, Mr. Lightning-rod-man, in the pauses of the thunder, be so good as to tell\\nme your reasons for esteeming this one room of the house the safest, and your\\nown one stand-point there the safest spot in it.”', 'There was now a little cessation of the storm for a while. The Lightning-rod\\nman seemed relieved, and replied:—', '“Your house is a one-storied house, with an attic and a cellar; this room\\nis between. Hence its comparative safety. Because lightning sometimes passes\\nfrom the clouds to the earth, and sometimes from the earth to the clouds. Do\\nyou comprehend?—and I choose the middle of the room, because if the\\nlightning should strike the house at all, it would come down the chimney or\\nwalls; so, obviously, the further you are from them, the better. Come hither to\\nme, now.”', '“Presently. Something you just said, instead of alarming me, has\\nstrangely inspired confidence.”', '“What have I said?”', '“You said that sometimes lightning flashes from the earth to the\\nclouds.”', '“Aye, the returning-stroke, as it is called; when the earth, being\\novercharged with the fluid, flashes its surplus upward.”', '“The returning-stroke; that is, from earth to sky. Better and better. But\\ncome here on the hearth and dry yourself.”', '“I am better here, and better wet.”', '“How?”', '“It is the safest thing you can do—Hark, again!—to get\\nyourself thoroughly drenched in a thunder-storm. Wet clothes are better\\nconductors than the body; and so, if the lightning strike, it might pass down\\nthe wet clothes without touching the body. The storm deepens again. Have you a\\nrug in the house? Rugs are non-conductors. Get one, that I may stand on it\\nhere, and you, too. The skies blacken—it is dusk at noon. Hark!—the\\nrug, the rug!”', 'I gave him one; while the hooded mountains seemed closing and tumbling into the\\ncottage.', '“And now, since our being dumb will not help us,” said I, resuming\\nmy place, “let me hear your precautions in traveling during\\nthunder-storms.”', '“Wait till this one is passed.”', '“Nay, proceed with the precautions. You stand in the safest possible\\nplace according to your own account. Go on.”', '“Briefly, then. I avoid pine-trees, high houses, lonely barns, upland\\npastures, running water, flocks of cattle and sheep, a crowd of men. If I\\ntravel on foot—as to-day—I do not walk fast; if in my buggy, I\\ntouch not its back or sides; if on horseback, I dismount and lead the horse.\\nBut of all things, I avoid tall men.”', '“Do I dream? Man avoid man? and in danger-time, too.”', '“Tall men in a thunder-storm I avoid. Are you so grossly ignorant as not\\nto know, that the height of a six-footer is sufficient to discharge an electric\\ncloud upon him? Are not lonely Kentuckians, ploughing, smit in the unfinished\\nfurrow? Nay, if the six-footer stand by running water, the cloud will sometimes\\nselect him as its conductor to that running water. Hark! Sure, yon black\\npinnacle is split. Yes, a man is a good conductor. The lightning goes through\\nand through a man, but only peels a tree. But sir, you have kept me so long\\nanswering your questions, that I have not yet come to business. Will you order\\none of my rods? Look at this specimen one? See: it is of the best of copper.\\nCopper’s the best conductor. Your house is low; but being upon the\\nmountains, that lowness does not one whit depress it. You mountaineers are most\\nexposed. In mountainous countries the lightning-rod man should have most\\nbusiness. Look at the specimen, sir. One rod will answer for a house so small\\nas this. Look over these recommendations. Only one rod, sir; cost, only twenty\\ndollars. Hark! There go all the granite Taconics and Hoosics dashed together\\nlike pebbles. By the sound, that must have struck something. An elevation of\\nfive feet above the house, will protect twenty feet radius all about the rod.\\nOnly twenty dollars, sir—a dollar a foot.\\nHark!—Dreadful!—Will you order? Will you buy? Shall I put down your\\nname? Think of being a heap of charred offal, like a haltered horse burnt in\\nhis stall; and all in one flash!”', '“You pretended envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to and\\nfrom Jupiter Tonans,” laughed I; “you mere man who come here to put\\nyou and your pipestem between clay and sky, do you think that because you can\\nstrike a bit of green light from the Leyden jar, that you can thoroughly avert\\nthe supernal bolt? Your rod rusts, or breaks, and where are you? Who has\\nempowered you, you Tetzel, to peddle round your indulgences from divine\\nordinations? The hairs of our heads are numbered, and the days of our lives. In\\nthunder as in sunshine, I stand at ease in the hands of my God. False\\nnegotiator, away! See, the scroll of the storm is rolled back; the house is\\nunharmed; and in the blue heavens I read in the rainbow, that the Deity will\\nnot, of purpose, make war on man’s earth.”', '“Impious wretch!” foamed the stranger, blackening in the face as\\nthe rainbow beamed, “I will publish your infidel notions.”', 'The scowl grew blacker on his face; the indigo-circles enlarged round his eyes\\nas the storm-rings round the midnight moon. He sprang upon me; his tri-forked\\nthing at my heart.', 'I seized it; I snapped it; I dashed it; I trod it; and dragging the dark\\nlightning-king out of my door, flung his elbowed, copper sceptre after him.', 'But spite of my treatment, and spite of my dissuasive talk of him to my\\nneighbors, the Lightning-rod man still dwells in the land; still travels in\\nstorm-time, and drives a brave trade with the fears of man.', '—“That may not be, said then the ferryman,\\nLeast we unweeting hap to be fordonne;\\nFor those same islands seeming now and than,\\nAre not firme land, nor any certein wonne,\\nBut stragling plots which to and fro do ronne\\nIn the wide waters; therefore are they hight\\nThe Wandering Islands; therefore do them shonne;\\nFor they have oft drawne many a wandring wight\\nInto most deadly daunger and distressed plight;\\nFor whosoever once hath fastened\\nHis foot thereon may never it secure\\nBut wandreth evermore uncertein and unsure.”', '“Darke, dolefull, dreary, like a greedy grave,\\nThat still for carrion carcasses doth crave;\\nOn top whereof ay dwelt the ghastly owl,\\nShrieking his balefull note, which ever drave\\nFar from that haunt all other cheerful fowl,\\nAnd all about it wandring ghosts did wayle and howl.”', 'Take five-and-twenty heaps of cinders dumped here and there in an outside city\\nlot; imagine some of them magnified into mountains, and the vacant lot the sea;\\nand you will have a fit idea of the general aspect of the Encantadas, or\\nEnchanted Isles. A group rather of extinct volcanoes than of isles; looking\\nmuch as the world at large might, after a penal conflagration.', 'It is to be doubted whether any spot of earth can, in desolateness, furnish a\\nparallel to this group. Abandoned cemeteries of long ago, old cities by\\npiecemeal tumbling to their ruin, these are melancholy enough; but, like all\\nelse which has but once been associated with humanity, they still awaken in us\\nsome thoughts of sympathy, however sad. Hence, even the Dead Sea, along with\\nwhatever other emotions it may at times inspire, does not fail to touch in the\\npilgrim some of his less unpleasurable feelings.', 'And as for solitariness; the great forests of the north, the expanses of\\nunnavigated waters, the Greenland ice-fields, are the profoundest of solitudes\\nto a human observer; still the magic of their changeable tides and seasons\\nmitigates their terror; because, though unvisited by men, those forests are\\nvisited by the May; the remotest seas reflect familiar stars even as Lake Erie\\ndoes; and in the clear air of a fine Polar day, the irradiated, azure ice shows\\nbeautifully as malachite.', 'But the special curse, as one may call it, of the Encantadas, that which exalts\\nthem in desolation above Idumea and the Pole, is, that to them change never\\ncomes; neither the change of seasons nor of sorrows. Cut by the Equator, they\\nknow not autumn, and they know not spring; while already reduced to the lees of\\nfire, ruin itself can work little more upon them. The showers refresh the\\ndeserts; but in these isles, rain never falls. Like split Syrian gourds left\\nwithering in the sun, they are cracked by an everlasting drought beneath a\\ntorrid sky. “Have mercy upon me,” the wailing spirit of the\\nEncantadas seems to cry, “and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his\\nfinger in water and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.”', 'Another feature in these isles is their emphatic uninhabitableness. It is\\ndeemed a fit type of all-forsaken overthrow, that the jackal should den in the\\nwastes of weedy Babylon; but the Encantadas refuse to harbor even the outcasts\\nof the beasts. Man and wolf alike disown them. Little but reptile life is here\\nfound: tortoises, lizards, immense spiders, snakes, and that strangest anomaly\\nof outlandish nature, the aguano. No voice, no low, no howl is heard;\\nthe chief sound of life here is a hiss.', 'On most of the isles where vegetation is found at all, it is more ungrateful\\nthan the blankness of Aracama. Tangled thickets of wiry bushes, without fruit\\nand without a name, springing up among deep fissures of calcined rock, and\\ntreacherously masking them; or a parched growth of distorted cactus trees.', 'In many places the coast is rock-bound, or, more properly, clinker-bound;\\ntumbled masses of blackish or greenish stuff like the dross of an iron-furnace,\\nforming dark clefts and caves here and there, into which a ceaseless sea pours\\na fury of foam; overhanging them with a swirl of gray, haggard mist, amidst\\nwhich sail screaming flights of unearthly birds heightening the dismal din.\\nHowever calm the sea without, there is no rest for these swells and those\\nrocks; they lash and are lashed, even when the outer ocean is most at peace\\nwith, itself. On the oppressive, clouded days, such as are peculiar to this\\npart of the watery Equator, the dark, vitrified masses, many of which raise\\nthemselves among white whirlpools and breakers in detached and perilous places\\noff the shore, present a most Plutonian sight. In no world but a fallen one\\ncould such lands exist.', 'Those parts of the strand free from the marks of fire, stretch away in wide\\nlevel beaches of multitudinous dead shells, with here and there decayed bits of\\nsugar-cane, bamboos, and cocoanuts, washed upon this other and darker world\\nfrom the charming palm isles to the westward and southward; all the way from\\nParadise to Tartarus; while mixed with the relics of distant beauty you will\\nsometimes see fragments of charred wood and mouldering ribs of wrecks. Neither\\nwill any one be surprised at meeting these last, after observing the\\nconflicting currents which eddy throughout nearly all the wide channels of the\\nentire group. The capriciousness of the tides of air sympathizes with those of\\nthe sea. Nowhere is the wind so light, baffling, and every way unreliable, and\\nso given to perplexing calms, as at the Encantadas. Nigh a month has been spent\\nby a ship going from one isle to another, though but ninety miles between; for\\nowing to the force of the current, the boats employed to tow barely suffice to\\nkeep the craft from sweeping upon the cliffs, but do nothing towards\\naccelerating her voyage. Sometimes it is impossible for a vessel from afar to\\nfetch up with the group itself, unless large allowances for prospective lee-way\\nhave been made ere its coming in sight. And yet, at other times, there is a\\nmysterious indraft, which irresistibly draws a passing vessel among the isles,\\nthough not bound to them.', 'True, at one period, as to some extent at the present day, large fleets of\\nwhalemen cruised for spermaceti upon what some seamen call the Enchanted\\nGround. But this, as in due place will be described, was off the great outer\\nisle of Albemarle, away from the intricacies of the smaller isles, where there\\nis plenty of sea-room; and hence, to that vicinity, the above remarks do not\\naltogether apply; though even there the current runs at times with singular\\nforce, shifting, too, with as singular a caprice.', 'Indeed, there are seasons when currents quite unaccountable prevail for a great\\ndistance round about the total group, and are so strong and irregular as to\\nchange a vessel’s course against the helm, though sailing at the rate of\\nfour or five miles the hour. The difference in the reckonings of navigators,\\nproduced by these causes, along with the light and variable winds, long\\nnourished a persuasion, that there existed two distinct clusters of isles in\\nthe parallel of the Encantadas, about a hundred leagues apart. Such was the\\nidea of their earlier visitors, the Buccaneers; and as late as 1750, the charts\\nof that part of the Pacific accorded with the strange delusion. And this\\napparent fleetingness and unreality of the locality of the isles was most\\nprobably one reason for the Spaniards calling them the Encantada, or Enchanted\\nGroup.', 'But not uninfluenced by their character, as they now confessedly exist, the\\nmodern voyager will be inclined to fancy that the bestowal of this name might\\nhave in part originated in that air of spell-bound desertness which so\\nsignificantly invests the isles. Nothing can better suggest the aspect of once\\nliving things malignly crumbled from ruddiness into ashes. Apples of Sodom,\\nafter touching, seem these isles.', 'However wavering their place may seem by reason of the currents, they\\nthemselves, at least to one upon the shore, appear invariably the same: fixed,\\ncast, glued into the very body of cadaverous death.', 'Nor would the appellation, enchanted, seem misapplied in still another sense.\\nFor concerning the peculiar reptile inhabitant of these wilds—whose\\npresence gives the group its second Spanish name, Gallipagos—concerning\\nthe tortoises found here, most mariners have long cherished a superstition, not\\nmore frightful than grotesque. They earnestly believe that all wicked\\nsea-officers, more especially commodores and captains, are at death (and, in\\nsome cases, before death) transformed into tortoises; thenceforth dwelling upon\\nthese hot aridities, sole solitary lords of Asphaltum.', 'Doubtless, so quaintly dolorous a thought was originally inspired by the\\nwoe-begone landscape itself; but more particularly, perhaps, by the tortoises.\\nFor, apart from their strictly physical features, there is something strangely\\nself-condemned in the appearance of these creatures. Lasting sorrow and penal\\nhopelessness are in no animal form so suppliantly expressed as in theirs; while\\nthe thought of their wonderful longevity does not fail to enhance the\\nimpression.', 'Nor even at the risk of meriting the charge of absurdly believing in\\nenchantments, can I restrain the admission that sometimes, even now, when\\nleaving the crowded city to wander out July and August among the Adirondack\\nMountains, far from the influences of towns and proportionally nigh to the\\nmysterious ones of nature; when at such times I sit me down in the mossy head\\nof some deep-wooded gorge, surrounded by prostrate trunks of blasted pines and\\nrecall, as in a dream, my other and far-distant rovings in the baked heart of\\nthe charmed isles; and remember the sudden glimpses of dusky shells, and long\\nlanguid necks protruded from the leafless thickets; and again have beheld the\\nvitreous inland rocks worn down and grooved into deep ruts by ages and ages of\\nthe slow draggings of tortoises in quest of pools of scanty water; I can hardly\\nresist the feeling that in my time I have indeed slept upon evilly enchanted\\nground.', 'Nay, such is the vividness of my memory, or the magic of my fancy, that I know\\nnot whether I am not the occasional victim of optical delusion concerning the\\nGallipagos. For, often in scenes of social merriment, and especially at revels\\nheld by candle-light in old-fashioned mansions, so that shadows are thrown into\\nthe further recesses of an angular and spacious room, making them put on a look\\nof haunted undergrowth of lonely woods, I have drawn the attention of my\\ncomrades by my fixed gaze and sudden change of air, as I have seemed to see,\\nslowly emerging from those imagined solitudes, and heavily crawling along the\\nfloor, the ghost of a gigantic tortoise, with “Memento * * * * *”\\nburning in live letters upon his back.', '“Most ugly shapes and horrible aspects,\\nSuch as Dame Nature selfe mote feare to see,\\nOr shame, that ever should so fowle defects\\nFrom her most cunning hand escaped bee;\\nAll dreadfull pourtraicts of deformitee.\\nNo wonder if these do a man appall;\\nFor all that here at home we dreadfull hold\\nBe but as bugs to fearen babes withall\\nCompared to the creatures in these isles’ entrall', '“Fear naught, then said the palmer, well avized,\\nFor these same monsters are not there indeed,\\nBut are into these fearful shapes disguized.', '“And lifting up his vertuous staffe on high,\\nThen all that dreadful armie fast gan flye\\nInto great Zethy’s bosom, where they hidden lye.”', 'In view of the description given, may one be gay upon the Encantadas? Yes: that\\nis, find one the gayety, and he will be gay. And, indeed, sackcloth and ashes\\nas they are, the isles are not perhaps unmitigated gloom. For while no\\nspectator can deny their claims to a most solemn and superstitious\\nconsideration, no more than my firmest resolutions can decline to behold the\\nspectre-tortoise when emerging from its shadowy recess; yet even the tortoise,\\ndark and melancholy as it is upon the back, still possesses a bright side; its\\ncalipee or breast-plate being sometimes of a faint yellowish or golden tinge.\\nMoreover, every one knows that tortoises as well as turtle are of such a make,\\nthat if you but put them on their backs you thereby expose their bright sides\\nwithout the possibility of their recovering themselves, and turning into view\\nthe other. But after you have done this, and because you have done this, you\\nshould not swear that the tortoise has no dark side. Enjoy the bright, keep it\\nturned up perpetually if you can, but be honest, and don’t deny the\\nblack. Neither should he, who cannot turn the tortoise from its natural\\nposition so as to hide the darker and expose his livelier aspect, like a great\\nOctober pumpkin in the sun, for that cause declare the creature to be one total\\ninky blot. The tortoise is both black and bright. But let us to particulars.', 'Some months before my first stepping ashore upon the group, my ship was\\ncruising in its close vicinity. One noon we found ourselves off the South Head\\nof Albemarle, and not very far from the land. Partly by way of freak, and\\npartly by way of spying out so strange a country, a boat’s crew was sent\\nashore, with orders to see all they could, and besides, bring back whatever\\ntortoises they could conveniently transport.', 'It was after sunset, when the adventurers returned. I looked down over the\\nship’s high side as if looking down over the curb of a well, and dimly\\nsaw the damp boat, deep in the sea with some unwonted weight. Ropes were dropt\\nover, and presently three huge antediluvian-looking tortoises, after much\\nstraining, were landed on deck. They seemed hardly of the seed of earth. We had\\nbeen broad upon the waters for five long months, a period amply sufficient to\\nmake all things of the land wear a fabulous hue to the dreamy mind. Had three\\nSpanish custom-house officers boarded us then, it is not unlikely that I should\\nhave curiously stared at them, felt of them, and stroked them much as savages\\nserve civilized guests. But instead of three custom-house officers, behold\\nthese really wondrous tortoises—none of your schoolboy\\nmud-turtles—but black as widower’s weeds, heavy as chests of plate,\\nwith vast shells medallioned and orbed like shields, and dented and blistered\\nlike shields that have breasted a battle, shaggy, too, here and there, with\\ndark green moss, and slimy with the spray of the sea. These mystic creatures,\\nsuddenly translated by night from unutterable solitudes to our peopled deck,\\naffected me in a manner not easy to unfold. They seemed newly crawled forth\\nfrom beneath the foundations of the world. Yea, they seemed the identical\\ntortoises whereon the Hindoo plants this total sphere. With a lantern I\\ninspected them more closely. Such worshipful venerableness of aspect! Such\\nfurry greenness mantling the rude peelings and healing the fissures of their\\nshattered shells. I no more saw three tortoises. They expanded—became\\ntransfigured. I seemed to see three Roman Coliseums in magnificent decay.', 'Ye oldest inhabitants of this, or any other isle, said I, pray, give me the\\nfreedom of your three-walled towns.', 'The great feeling inspired by these creatures was that of age:—dateless,\\nindefinite endurance. And in fact that any other creature can live and breathe\\nas long as the tortoise of the Encantadas, I will not readily believe. Not to\\nhint of their known capacity of sustaining life, while going without food for\\nan entire year, consider that impregnable armor of their living mail. What\\nother bodily being possesses such a citadel wherein to resist the assaults of\\nTime?', 'As, lantern in hand, I scraped among the moss and beheld the ancient scars of\\nbruises received in many a sullen fall among the marly mountains of the\\nisle—scars strangely widened, swollen, half obliterate, and yet distorted\\nlike those sometimes found in the bark of very hoary trees, I seemed an\\nantiquary of a geologist, studying the bird-tracks and ciphers upon the exhumed\\nslates trod by incredible creatures whose very ghosts are now defunct.', 'As I lay in my hammock that night, overhead I heard the slow weary draggings of\\nthe three ponderous strangers along the encumbered deck. Their stupidity or\\ntheir resolution was so great, that they never went aside for any impediment.\\nOne ceased his movements altogether just before the mid-watch. At sunrise I\\nfound him butted like a battering-ram against the immovable foot of the\\nforemast, and still striving, tooth and nail, to force the impossible passage.\\nThat these tortoises are the victims of a penal, or malignant, or perhaps a\\ndownright diabolical enchanter, seems in nothing more likely than in that\\nstrange infatuation of hopeless toil which so often possesses them. I have\\nknown them in their journeyings ram themselves heroically against rocks, and\\nlong abide there, nudging, wriggling, wedging, in order to displace them, and\\nso hold on their inflexible path. Their crowning curse is their drudging\\nimpulse to straightforwardness in a belittered world.', 'Meeting with no such hinderance as their companion did, the other tortoises\\nmerely fell foul of small stumbling-blocks—buckets, blocks, and coils of\\nrigging—and at times in the act of crawling over them would slip with an\\nastounding rattle to the deck. Listening to these draggings and concussions, I\\nthought me of the haunt from which they came; an isle full of metallic ravines\\nand gulches, sunk bottomlessly into the hearts of splintered mountains, and\\ncovered for many miles with inextricable thickets. I then pictured these three\\nstraight-forward monsters, century after century, writhing through the shades,\\ngrim as blacksmiths; crawling so slowly and ponderously, that not only did\\ntoad-stools and all fungus things grow beneath their feet, but a sooty moss\\nsprouted upon their backs. With them I lost myself in volcanic mazes; brushed\\naway endless boughs of rotting thickets; till finally in a dream I found myself\\nsitting crosslegged upon the foremost, a Brahmin similarly mounted upon either\\nside, forming a tripod of foreheads which upheld the universal cope.', 'Such was the wild nightmare begot by my first impression of the Encantadas\\ntortoise. But next evening, strange to say, I sat down with my shipmates, and\\nmade a merry repast from tortoise steaks, and tortoise stews; and supper over,\\nout knife, and helped convert the three mighty concave shells into three\\nfanciful soup-tureens, and polished the three flat yellowish calipees into\\nthree gorgeous salvers.', '“For they this tight the Rock of vile Reproach,\\nA dangerous and dreadful place,\\nTo which nor fish nor fowl did once approach,\\nBut yelling meaws with sea-gulls hoars and bace\\nAnd cormoyrants with birds of ravenous race,\\nWhich still sit waiting on that dreadful clift.”', '“With that the rolling sea resounding soft\\nIn his big base them fitly answered,\\nAnd on the Rock, the waves breaking aloft,\\nA solemn ineane unto them measured.”', '“Then he the boteman bad row easily,\\nAnd let him heare some part of that rare melody.”', '“Suddeinly an innumerable flight\\nOf harmefull fowles about them fluttering cride,\\nAnd with their wicked wings them oft did smight\\nAnd sore annoyed, groping in that griesly night.”', '“Even all the nation of unfortunate\\nAnd fatal birds about them flocked were.”', 'To go up into a high stone tower is not only a very fine thing in itself, but\\nthe very best mode of gaining a comprehensive view of the region round about.\\nIt is all the better if this tower stand solitary and alone, like that\\nmysterious Newport one, or else be sole survivor of some perished castle.', 'Now, with reference to the Enchanted Isles, we are fortunately supplied with\\njust such a noble point of observation in a remarkable rock, from its peculiar\\nfigure called of old by the Spaniards, Rock Rodondo, or Round Rock. Some two\\nhundred and fifty feet high, rising straight from the sea ten miles from land,\\nwith the whole mountainous group to the south and east. Rock Rodondo occupies,\\non a large scale, very much the position which the famous Campanile or detached\\nBell Tower of St. Mark does with respect to the tangled group of hoary edifices\\naround it.', 'Ere ascending, however, to gaze abroad upon the Encantadas, this sea-tower\\nitself claims attention. It is visible at the distance of thirty miles; and,\\nfully participating in that enchantment which pervades the group, when first\\nseen afar invariably is mistaken for a sail. Four leagues away, of a golden,\\nhazy noon, it seems some Spanish Admiral’s ship, stacked up with\\nglittering canvas. Sail ho! Sail ho! Sail ho! from all three masts. But coming\\nnigh, the enchanted frigate is transformed apace into a craggy keep.', 'My first visit to the spot was made in the gray of the morning. With a view of\\nfishing, we had lowered three boats and pulling some two miles from our vessel,\\nfound ourselves just before dawn of day close under the moon-shadow of Rodondo.\\nIts aspect was heightened, and yet softened, by the strange double twilight of\\nthe hour. The great full moon burnt in the low west like a half-spent beacon,\\ncasting a soft mellow tinge upon the sea like that cast by a waning fire of\\nembers upon a midnight hearth; while along the entire east the invisible sun\\nsent pallid intimations of his coming. The wind was light; the waves languid;\\nthe stars twinkled with a faint effulgence; all nature seemed supine with the\\nlong night watch, and half-suspended in jaded expectation of the sun. This was\\nthe critical hour to catch Rodondo in his perfect mood. The twilight was just\\nenough to reveal every striking point, without tearing away the dim investiture\\nof wonder.', 'From a broken stair-like base, washed, as the steps of a water-palace, by the\\nwaves, the tower rose in entablatures of strata to a shaven summit. These\\nuniform layers, which compose the mass, form its most peculiar feature. For at\\ntheir lines of junction they project flatly into encircling shelves, from top\\nto bottom, rising one above another in graduated series. And as the eaves of\\nany old barn or abbey are alive with swallows, so were all these rocky ledges\\nwith unnumbered sea-fowl. Eaves upon eaves, and nests upon nests. Here and\\nthere were long birdlime streaks of a ghostly white staining the tower from sea\\nto air, readily accounting for its sail-like look afar. All would have been\\nbewitchingly quiescent, were it not for the demoniac din created by the birds.\\nNot only were the eaves rustling with them, but they flew densely overhead,\\nspreading themselves into a winged and continually shifting canopy. The tower\\nis the resort of aquatic birds for hundreds of leagues around. To the north, to\\nthe east, to the west, stretches nothing but eternal ocean; so that the\\nman-of-war hawk coming from the coasts of North America, Polynesia, or Peru,\\nmakes his first land at Rodondo. And yet though Rodondo be terra-firma, no\\nland-bird ever lighted on it. Fancy a red-robin or a canary there! What a\\nfalling into the hands of the Philistines, when the poor warbler should be\\nsurrounded by such locust-flights of strong bandit birds, with long bills cruel\\nas daggers.', 'I know not where one can better study the Natural History of strange sea-fowl\\nthan at Rodondo. It is the aviary of Ocean. Birds light here which never\\ntouched mast or tree; hermit-birds, which ever fly alone; cloud-birds, familiar\\nwith unpierced zones of air.', 'Let us first glance low down to the lowermost shelf of all, which is the\\nwidest, too, and but a little space from high-water mark. What outlandish\\nbeings are these? Erect as men, but hardly as symmetrical, they stand all round\\nthe rock like sculptured caryatides, supporting the next range of eaves above.\\nTheir bodies are grotesquely misshapen; their bills short; their feet seemingly\\nlegless; while the members at their sides are neither fin, wing, nor arm. And\\ntruly neither fish, flesh, nor fowl is the penguin; as an edible, pertaining\\nneither to Carnival nor Lent; without exception the most ambiguous and least\\nlovely creature yet discovered by man. Though dabbling in all three elements,\\nand indeed possessing some rudimental claims to all, the penguin is at home in\\nnone. On land it stumps; afloat it sculls; in the air it flops. As if ashamed\\nof her failure, Nature keeps this ungainly child hidden away at the ends of the\\nearth, in the Straits of Magellan, and on the abased sea-story of Rodondo.', 'But look, what are yon wobegone regiments drawn up on the next shelf above?\\nwhat rank and file of large strange fowl? what sea Friars of Orders Gray?\\nPelicans. Their elongated bills, and heavy leathern pouches suspended thereto,\\ngive them the most lugubrious expression. A pensive race, they stand for hours\\ntogether without motion. Their dull, ashy plumage imparts an aspect as if they\\nhad been powdered over with cinders. A penitential bird, indeed, fitly haunting\\nthe shores of the clinkered Encantadas, whereon tormented Job himself might\\nhave well sat down and scraped himself with potsherds.', 'Higher up now we mark the gony, or gray albatross, anomalously so called, an\\nunsightly unpoetic bird, unlike its storied kinsman, which is the snow-white\\nghost of the haunted Capes of Hope and Horn.', 'As we still ascend from shelf to shelf, we find the tenants of the tower\\nserially disposed in order of their magnitude:—gannets, black and\\nspeckled haglets, jays, sea-hens, sperm-whale-birds, gulls of all\\nvarieties:—thrones, princedoms, powers, dominating one above another in\\nsenatorial array; while, sprinkled over all, like an ever-repeated fly in a\\ngreat piece of broidery, the stormy petrel or Mother Cary’s chicken\\nsounds his continual challenge and alarm. That this mysterious hummingbird of\\nocean—which, had it but brilliancy of hue, might, from its evanescent\\nliveliness, be almost called its butterfly, yet whose chirrup under the stern\\nis ominous to mariners as to the peasant the death-tick sounding from behind\\nthe chimney jamb—should have its special haunt at the Encantadas,\\ncontributes, in the seaman’s mind, not a little to their dreary spell.', 'As day advances the dissonant din augments. With ear-splitting cries the wild\\nbirds celebrate their matins. Each moment, flights push from the tower, and\\njoin the aerial choir hovering overhead, while their places below are supplied\\nby darting myriads. But down through all this discord of commotion, I hear\\nclear, silver, bugle-like notes unbrokenly falling, like oblique lines of\\nswift-slanting rain in a cascading shower. I gaze far up, and behold a\\nsnow-white angelic thing, with one long, lance-like feather thrust out behind.\\nIt is the bright, inspiriting chanticleer of ocean, the beauteous bird, from\\nits bestirring whistle of musical invocation, fitly styled the\\n“Boatswain’s Mate.”', 'The winged, life-clouding Rodondo had its full counterpart in the finny hosts\\nwhich peopled the waters at its base. Below the water-line, the rock seemed one\\nhoney-comb of grottoes, affording labyrinthine lurking-places for swarms of\\nfairy fish. All were strange; many exceedingly beautiful; and would have well\\ngraced the costliest glass globes in which gold-fish are kept for a show.\\nNothing was more striking than the complete novelty of many individuals of this\\nmultitude. Here hues were seen as yet unpainted, and figures which are\\nunengraved.', 'To show the multitude, avidity, and nameless fearlessness and tameness of these\\nfish, let me say, that often, marking through clear spaces of\\nwater—temporarily made so by the concentric dartings of the fish above\\nthe surface—certain larger and less unwary wights, which swam slow and\\ndeep; our anglers would cautiously essay to drop their lines down to these\\nlast. But in vain; there was no passing the uppermost zone. No sooner did the\\nhook touch the sea, than a hundred infatuates contended for the honor of\\ncapture. Poor fish of Rodondo! in your victimized confidence, you are of the\\nnumber of those who inconsiderately trust, while they do not understand, human\\nnature.', 'But the dawn is now fairly day. Band after band, the sea-fowl sail away to\\nforage the deep for their food. The tower is left solitary save the fish-caves\\nat its base. Its birdlime gleams in the golden rays like the whitewash of a\\ntall light-house, or the lofty sails of a cruiser. This moment, doubtless,\\nwhile we know it to be a dead desert rock other voyagers are taking oaths it is\\na glad populous ship.', 'But ropes now, and let us ascend. Yet soft, this is not so easy.', '—“That done, he leads him to the highest mount,\\nFrom whence, far off he unto him did show:”—', 'If you seek to ascend Rock Rodondo, take the following prescription. Go three\\nvoyages round the world as a main-royal-man of the tallest frigate that floats;\\nthen serve a year or two apprenticeship to the guides who conduct strangers up\\nthe Peak of Teneriffe; and as many more respectively to a rope-dancer, an\\nIndian juggler, and a chamois. This done, come and be rewarded by the view from\\nour tower. How we get there, we alone know. If we sought to tell others, what\\nthe wiser were they? Suffice it, that here at the summit you and I stand. Does\\nany balloonist, does the outlooking man in the moon, take a broader view of\\nspace? Much thus, one fancies, looks the universe from Milton’s celestial\\nbattlements. A boundless watery Kentucky. Here Daniel Boone would have dwelt\\ncontent.', 'Never heed for the present yonder Burnt District of the Enchanted Isles. Look\\nedgeways, as it were, past them, to the south. You see nothing; but permit me\\nto point out the direction, if not the place, of certain interesting objects in\\nthe vast sea, which, kissing this tower’s base, we behold unscrolling\\nitself towards the Antarctic Pole.', 'We stand now ten miles from the Equator. Yonder, to the East, some six hundred\\nmiles, lies the continent; this Rock being just about on the parallel of Quito.', 'Observe another thing here. We are at one of three uninhabited clusters, which,\\nat pretty nearly uniform distances from the main, sentinel, at long intervals\\nfrom each other, the entire coast of South America. In a peculiar manner, also,\\nthey terminate the South American character of country. Of the unnumbered\\nPolynesian chains to the westward, not one partakes of the qualities of the\\nEncantadas or Gallipagos, the isles of St. Felix and St. Ambrose, the isles\\nJuan-Fernandez and Massafuero. Of the first, it needs not here to speak. The\\nsecond lie a little above the Southern Tropic; lofty, inhospitable, and\\nuninhabitable rocks, one of which, presenting two round hummocks connected by a\\nlow reef, exactly resembles a huge double-headed shot. The last lie in the\\nlatitude of 33°; high, wild and cloven. Juan Fernandez is sufficiently famous\\nwithout further description. Massafuero is a Spanish name, expressive of the\\nfact, that the isle so called lies more without, that is, further off\\nthe main than its neighbor Juan. This isle Massafuero has a very imposing\\naspect at a distance of eight or ten miles. Approached in one direction, in\\ncloudy weather, its great overhanging height and rugged contour, and more\\nespecially a peculiar slope of its broad summits, give it much the air of a\\nvast iceberg drifting in tremendous poise. Its sides are split with dark\\ncavernous recesses, as an old cathedral with its gloomy lateral chapels.\\nDrawing nigh one of these gorges from sea, after a long voyage, and beholding\\nsome tatterdemalion outlaw, staff in hand, descending its steep rocks toward\\nyou, conveys a very queer emotion to a lover of the picturesque.', 'On fishing parties from ships, at various times, I have chanced to visit each\\nof these groups. The impression they give to the stranger pulling close up in\\nhis boat under their grim cliffs is, that surely he must be their first\\ndiscoverer, such, for the most part, is the unimpaired ... silence and\\nsolitude. And here, by the way, the mode in which these isles were really first\\nlighted upon by Europeans is not unworthy of mention, especially as what is\\nabout to be said, likewise applies to the original discovery of our Encantadas.', 'Prior to the year 1563, the voyages made by Spanish ships from Peru to Chili,\\nwere full of difficulty. Along this coast, the winds from the South most\\ngenerally prevail; and it had been an invariable custom to keep close in with\\nthe land, from a superstitious conceit on the part of the Spaniards, that were\\nthey to lose sight of it, the eternal trade-wind would waft them into unending\\nwaters, from whence would be no return. Here, involved among tortuous capes and\\nheadlands, shoals and reefs, beating, too, against a continual head wind, often\\nlight, and sometimes for days and weeks sunk into utter calm, the provincial\\nvessels, in many cases, suffered the extremest hardships, in passages, which at\\nthe present day seem to have been incredibly protracted. There is on record in\\nsome collections of nautical disasters, an account of one of these ships,\\nwhich, starting on a voyage whose duration was estimated at ten days, spent\\nfour months at sea, and indeed never again entered harbor, for in the end she\\nwas cast away. Singular to tell, this craft never encountered a gale, but was\\nthe vexed sport of malicious calms and currents. Thrice, out of provisions, she\\nput back to an intermediate port, and started afresh, but only yet again to\\nreturn. Frequent fogs enveloped her; so that no observation could be had of her\\nplace, and once, when all hands were joyously anticipating sight of their\\ndestination, lo! the vapors lifted and disclosed the mountains from which they\\nhad taken their first departure. In the like deceptive vapors she at last\\nstruck upon a reef, whence ensued a long series of calamities too sad to\\ndetail.', 'It was the famous pilot, Juan Fernandez, immortalized by the island named after\\nhim, who put an end to these coasting tribulations, by boldly venturing the\\nexperiment—as De Gama did before him with respect to Europe—of\\nstanding broad out from land. Here he found the winds favorable for getting to\\nthe South, and by running westward till beyond the influences of the trades, he\\nregained the coast without difficulty; making the passage which, though in a\\nhigh degree circuitous, proved far more expeditious than the nominally direct\\none. Now it was upon these new tracks, and about the year 1670, or thereabouts,\\nthat the Enchanted Isles, and the rest of the sentinel groups, as they may be\\ncalled, were discovered. Though I know of no account as to whether any of them\\nwere found inhabited or no, it may be reasonably concluded that they have been\\nimmemorial solitudes. But let us return to Redondo.', 'Southwest from our tower lies all Polynesia, hundreds of leagues away; but\\nstraight west, on the precise line of his parallel, no land rises till your\\nkeel is beached upon the Kingsmills, a nice little sail of, say 5000 miles.', 'Having thus by such distant references—with Rodondo the only possible\\nones—settled our relative place on the sea, let us consider objects not\\nquite so remote. Behold the grim and charred Enchanted Isles. This nearest\\ncrater-shaped headland is part of Albemarle, the largest of the group, being\\nsome sixty miles or more long, and fifteen broad. Did you ever lay eye on the\\nreal genuine Equator? Have you ever, in the largest sense, toed the Line? Well,\\nthat identical crater-shaped headland there, all yellow lava, is cut by the\\nEquator exactly as a knife cuts straight through the centre of a pumpkin pie.\\nIf you could only see so far, just to one side of that same headland, across\\nyon low dikey ground, you would catch sight of the isle of Narborough, the\\nloftiest land of the cluster; no soil whatever; one seamed clinker from top to\\nbottom; abounding in black caves like smithies; its metallic shore ringing\\nunder foot like plates of iron; its central volcanoes standing grouped like a\\ngigantic chimney-stack.', 'Narborough and Albemarle are neighbors after a quite curious fashion. A\\nfamiliar diagram will illustrate this strange neighborhood:', 'Cut a channel at the above letter joint, and the middle transverse limb is\\nNarborough, and all the rest is Albemarle. Volcanic Narborough lies in the\\nblack jaws of Albemarle like a wolf’s red tongue in his open month.', 'If now you desire the population of Albemarle, I will give you, in round\\nnumbers, the statistics, according to the most reliable estimates made upon the\\nspot:', 'exclusive of an incomputable host of fiends, ant-eaters, man-haters, and\\nsalamanders.', 'Albemarle opens his mouth towards the setting sun. His distended jaws form a\\ngreat bay, which Narborough, his tongue, divides into halves, one whereof is\\ncalled Weather Bay, the other Lee Bay; while the volcanic promontories,\\nterminating his coasts, are styled South Head and North Head. I note this,\\nbecause these bays are famous in the annals of the Sperm Whale Fishery. The\\nwhales come here at certain seasons to calve. When ships first cruised\\nhereabouts, I am told, they used to blockade the entrance of Lee Bay, when\\ntheir boats going round by Weather Bay, passed through Narborough channel, and\\nso had the Leviathans very neatly in a pen.', 'The day after we took fish at the base of this Round Tower, we had a fine wind,\\nand shooting round the north headland, suddenly descried a fleet of full thirty\\nsail, all beating to windward like a squadron in line. A brave sight as ever\\nman saw. A most harmonious concord of rushing keels. Their thirty kelsons\\nhummed like thirty harp-strings, and looked as straight whilst they left their\\nparallel traces on the sea. But there proved too many hunters for the game. The\\nfleet broke up, and went their separate ways out of sight, leaving my own ship\\nand two trim gentlemen of London. These last, finding no luck either, likewise\\nvanished; and Lee Bay, with all its appurtenances, and without a rival,\\ndevolved to us.', 'The way of cruising here is this. You keep hovering about the entrance of the\\nbay, in one beat and out the next. But at times—not always, as in other\\nparts of the group—a racehorse of a current sweeps right across its\\nmouth. So, with all sails set, you carefully ply your tacks. How often,\\nstanding at the foremast head at sunrise, with our patient prow pointed in\\nbetween these isles, did I gaze upon that land, not of cakes, but of clinkers,\\nnot of streams of sparkling water, but arrested torrents of tormented lava.', 'As the ship runs in from the open sea, Narborough presents its side in one dark\\ncraggy mass, soaring up some five or six thousand feet, at which point it hoods\\nitself in heavy clouds, whose lowest level fold is as clearly defined against\\nthe rocks as the snow-line against the Andes. There is dire mischief going on\\nin that upper dark. There toil the demons of fire, who, at intervals, irradiate\\nthe nights with a strange spectral illumination for miles and miles around, but\\nunaccompanied by any further demonstration; or else, suddenly announce\\nthemselves by terrific concussions, and the full drama of a volcanic eruption.\\nThe blacker that cloud by day, the more may you look for light by night. Often\\nwhalemen have found themselves cruising nigh that burning mountain when all\\naglow with a ball-room blaze. Or, rather, glass-works, you may call this same\\nvitreous isle of Narborough, with its tall chimney-stacks.', 'Where we still stand, here on Rodondo, we cannot see all the other isles, but\\nit is a good place from which to point out where they lie. Yonder, though, to\\nthe E.N.E., I mark a distant dusky ridge. It is Abington Isle, one of the most\\nnortherly of the group; so solitary, remote, and blank, it looks like\\nNo-Man’s Land seen off our northern shore. I doubt whether two human\\nbeings ever touched upon that spot. So far as yon Abington Isle is concerned,\\nAdam and his billions of posterity remain uncreated.', 'Ranging south of Abington, and quite out of sight behind the long spine of\\nAlbemarle, lies James’s Isle, so called by the early Buccaneers after the\\nluckless Stuart, Duke of York. Observe here, by the way, that, excepting the\\nisles particularized in comparatively recent times, and which mostly received\\nthe names of famous Admirals, the Encantadas were first christened by the\\nSpaniards; but these Spanish names were generally effaced on English charts by\\nthe subsequent christenings of the Buccaneers, who, in the middle of the\\nseventeenth century, called them after English noblemen and kings. Of these\\nloyal freebooters and the things which associate their name with the\\nEncantadas, we shall hear anon. Nay, for one little item, immediately; for\\nbetween James’s Isle and Albemarle, lies a fantastic islet, strangely\\nknown as “Cowley’s Enchanted Isle.” But, as all the group is\\ndeemed enchanted, the reason must be given for the spell within a spell\\ninvolved by this particular designation. The name was bestowed by that\\nexcellent Buccaneer himself, on his first visit here. Speaking in his published\\nvoyages of this spot, he says—“My fancy led me to call it\\nCowley’s Enchanted Isle, for, we having had a sight of it upon several\\npoints of the compass, it appeared always in so many different forms; sometimes\\nlike a ruined fortification; upon another point like a great city,” etc.\\nNo wonder though, that among the Encantadas all sorts of ocular deceptions and\\nmirages should be met.', 'That Cowley linked his name with this self-transforming and bemocking isle,\\nsuggests the possibility that it conveyed to him some meditative image of\\nhimself. At least, as is not impossible, if he were any relative of the\\nmildly-thoughtful and self-upbraiding poet Cowley, who lived about his time,\\nthe conceit might seem unwarranted; for that sort of thing evinced in the\\nnaming of this isle runs in the blood, and may be seen in pirates as in poets.', 'Still south of James’s Isle lie Jervis Isle, Duncan Isle,\\nGrossman’s Isle, Brattle Isle, Wood’s Isle, Chatham Isle, and\\nvarious lesser isles, for the most part an archipelago of aridities, without\\ninhabitant, history, or hope of either in all time to come. But not far from\\nthese are rather notable isles—Barrington, Charles’s, Norfolk, and\\nHood’s. Succeeding chapters will reveal some ground for their notability.', '“Looking far forth into the ocean wide,\\nA goodly ship with banners bravely dight,\\nAnd flag in her top-gallant I espide,\\nThrough the main sea making her merry flight.”', 'Ere quitting Rodondo, it must not be omitted that here, in 1813, the U.S.\\nfrigate Essex, Captain David Porter, came near leaving her bones. Lying\\nbecalmed one morning with a strong current setting her rapidly towards the\\nrock, a strange sail was descried, which—not out of keeping with alleged\\nenchantments of the neighborhood—seemed to be staggering under a violent\\nwind, while the frigate lay lifeless as if spell-bound. But a light air\\nspringing up, all sail was made by the frigate in chase of the enemy, as\\nsupposed—he being deemed an English whale-ship—but the rapidity of\\nthe current was so great, that soon all sight was lost of him; and, at\\nmeridian, the Essex, spite of her drags, was driven so close under the\\nfoam-lashed cliffs of Rodondo that, for a time, all hands gave her up. A smart\\nbreeze, however, at last helped her off, though the escape was so critical as\\nto seem almost miraculous.', 'Thus saved from destruction herself, she now made use of that salvation to\\ndestroy the other vessel, if possible. Renewing the chase in the direction in\\nwhich the stranger had disappeared, sight was caught of him the following\\nmorning. Upon being descried he hoisted American colors and stood away from the\\nEssex. A calm ensued; when, still confident that the stranger was an\\nEnglishman, Porter dispatched a cutter, not to board the enemy, but drive back\\nhis boats engaged in towing him. The cutter succeeded. Cutters were\\nsubsequently sent to capture him; the stranger now showing English colors in\\nplace of American. But, when the frigate’s boats were within a short\\ndistance of their hoped-for prize, another sudden breeze sprang up; the\\nstranger, under all sail, bore off to the westward, and, ere night, was hull\\ndown ahead of the Essex, which, all this time, lay perfectly becalmed.', 'This enigmatic craft—American in the morning, and English in the\\nevening—her sails full of wind in a calm—was never again beheld. An\\nenchanted ship no doubt. So, at least, the sailors swore.', 'This cruise of the Essex in the Pacific during the war of 1812, is, perhaps,\\nthe strangest and most stirring to be found in the history of the American\\nnavy. She captured the furthest wandering vessels; visited the remotest seas\\nand isles; long hovered in the charmed vicinity of the enchanted group; and,\\nfinally, valiantly gave up the ghost fighting two English frigates in the\\nharbor of Valparaiso. Mention is made of her here for the same reason that the\\nBuccaneers will likewise receive record; because, like them, by long cruising\\namong the isles, tortoise-hunting upon their shores, and generally exploring\\nthem; for these and other reasons, the Essex is peculiarly associated with the\\nEncantadas.', 'Here be it said that you have but three, eye-witness authorities worth\\nmentioning touching the Enchanted Isles:—Cowley, the Buccaneer (1684);\\nColnet the whaling-ground explorer (1798); Porter, the post captain (1813).\\nOther than these you have but barren, bootless allusions from some few passing\\nvoyagers or compilers.', '“Let us all servile base subjection scorn,\\nAnd as we be sons of the earth so wide,\\nLet us our father’s heritage divide,\\nAnd challenge to ourselves our portions dew\\nOf all the patrimony, which a few\\nhold on hugger-mugger in their hand.”', '“Lords of the world, and so will wander free,\\nWhereso us listeth, uncontroll’d of any.”', '“How bravely now we live, how jocund, how near the\\nfirst inheritance, without fear, how free from little troubles!”', 'Near two centuries ago Barrington Isle was the resort of that famous wing of\\nthe West Indian Buccaneers, which, upon their repulse from the Cuban waters,\\ncrossing the Isthmus of Darien, ravaged the Pacific side of the Spanish\\ncolonies, and, with the regularity and timing of a modern mail, waylaid the\\nroyal treasure-ships plying between Manilla and Acapulco. After the toils of\\npiratic war, here they came to say their prayers, enjoy their free-and-easies,\\ncount their crackers from the cask, their doubloons from the keg, and measure\\ntheir silks of Asia with long Toledos for their yard-sticks.', 'As a secure retreat, an undiscoverable hiding-place, no spot in those days\\ncould have been better fitted. In the centre of a vast and silent sea, but very\\nlittle traversed—surrounded by islands, whose inhospitable aspect might\\nwell drive away the chance navigator—and yet within a few days’\\nsail of the opulent countries which they made their prey—the unmolested\\nBuccaneers found here that tranquillity which they fiercely denied to every\\ncivilized harbor in that part of the world. Here, after stress of weather, or a\\ntemporary drubbing at the hands of their vindictive foes, or in swift flight\\nwith golden booty, those old marauders came, and lay snugly out of all\\nharm’s reach. But not only was the place a harbor of safety, and a bower\\nof ease, but for utility in other things it was most admirable.', 'Barrington Isle is, in many respects, singularly adapted to careening,\\nrefitting, refreshing, and other seamen’s purposes. Not only has it good\\nwater, and good anchorage, well sheltered from all winds by the high land of\\nAlbemarle, but it is the least unproductive isle of the group. Tortoises good\\nfor food, trees good for fuel, and long grass good for bedding, abound here,\\nand there are pretty natural walks, and several landscapes to be seen. Indeed,\\nthough in its locality belonging to the Enchanted group, Barrington Isle is so\\nunlike most of its neighbors, that it would hardly seem of kin to them.', '“I once landed on its western side,” says a sentimental voyager\\nlong ago, “where it faces the black buttress of Albemarle. I walked\\nbeneath groves of trees—not very lofty, and not palm trees, or orange\\ntrees, or peach trees, to be sure—but, for all that, after long\\nsea-faring, very beautiful to walk under, even though they supplied no fruit.\\nAnd here, in calm spaces at the heads of glades, and on the shaded tops of\\nslopes commanding the most quiet scenery—what do you think I saw? Seats\\nwhich might have served Brahmins and presidents of peace societies. Fine old\\nruins of what had once been symmetric lounges of stone and turf, they bore\\nevery mark both of artificialness and age, and were, undoubtedly, made by the\\nBuccaneers. One had been a long sofa, with back and arms, just such a sofa as\\nthe poet Gray might have loved to throw himself upon, his Crebillon in hand.', '“Though they sometimes tarried here for months at a time, and used the\\nspot for a storing-place for spare spars, sails, and casks; yet it is highly\\nimprobable that the Buccaneers ever erected dwelling-houses upon the isle. They\\nnever were here except their ships remained, and they would most likely have\\nslept on board. I mention this, because I cannot avoid the thought, that it is\\nhard to impute the construction of these romantic seats to any other motive\\nthan one of pure peacefulness and kindly fellowship with nature. That the\\nBuccaneers perpetrated the greatest outrages is very true—that some of\\nthem were mere cutthroats is not to be denied; but we know that here and there\\namong their host was a Dampier, a Wafer, and a Cowley, and likewise other men,\\nwhose worst reproach was their desperate fortunes—whom persecution, or\\nadversity, or secret and unavengeable wrongs, had driven from Christian society\\nto seek the melancholy solitude or the guilty adventures of the sea. At any\\nrate, long as those ruins of seats on Barrington remain, the most singular\\nmonuments are furnished to the fact, that all of the Buccaneers were not\\nunmitigated monsters.', '“But during my ramble on the isle I was not long in discovering other\\ntokens, of things quite in accordance with those wild traits, popularly, and no\\ndoubt truly enough, imputed to the freebooters at large. Had I picked up old\\nsails and rusty hoops I would only have thought of the ship’s carpenter\\nand cooper. But I found old cutlasses and daggers reduced to mere threads of\\nrust, which, doubtless, had stuck between Spanish ribs ere now. These were\\nsigns of the murderer and robber; the reveler likewise had left his trace.\\nMixed with shells, fragments of broken jars were lying here and there, high up\\nupon the beach. They were precisely like the jars now used upon the Spanish\\ncoast for the wine and Pisco spirits of that country.', '“With a rusty dagger-fragment in one hand, and a bit of a wine-jar in\\nanother, I sat me down on the ruinous green sofa I have spoken of, and\\nbethought me long and deeply of these same Buccaneers. Could it be possible,\\nthat they robbed and murdered one day, reveled the next, and rested themselves\\nby turning meditative philosophers, rural poets, and seat-builders on the\\nthird? Not very improbable, after all.

And hereby hangs a history\\nwhich I gathered long ago from a shipmate learned in all the lore of outlandish\\nlife.', 'During the successful revolt of the Spanish provinces from Old Spain, there\\nfought on behalf of Peru a certain Creole adventurer from Cuba, who, by his\\nbravery and good fortune, at length advanced himself to high rank in the\\npatriot army. The war being ended, Peru found itself like many valorous\\ngentlemen, free and independent enough, but with few shot in the locker. In\\nother words, Peru had not wherewithal to pay off its troops. But the\\nCreole—I forget his name—volunteered to take his pay in lands. So\\nthey told him he might have his pick of the Enchanted Isles, which were then,\\nas they still remain, the nominal appanage of Peru. The soldier straightway\\nembarks thither, explores the group, returns to Callao, and says he will take a\\ndeed of Charles’s Isle. Moreover, this deed must stipulate that\\nthenceforth Charles’s Isle is not only the sole property of the Creole,\\nbut is forever free of Peru, even as Peru of Spain. To be short, this\\nadventurer procures himself to be made in effect Supreme Lord of the Island,\\none of the princes of the powers of the earth.', 'The American Spaniards have long been in the habit of making presents of\\nislands to deserving individuals. The pilot Juan Fernandez procured a deed of\\nthe isle named after him, and for some years resided there before Selkirk came.\\nIt is supposed, however, that he eventually contracted the blues upon his\\nprincely property, for after a time he returned to the main, and as report\\ngoes, became a very garrulous barber in the city of Lima.', 'He now sends forth a proclamation inviting subjects to his as yet unpopulated\\nkingdom. Some eighty souls, men and women, respond; and being provided by their\\nleader with necessaries, and tools of various sorts, together with a few cattle\\nand goats, take ship for the promised land; the last arrival on board, prior to\\nsailing, being the Creole himself, accompanied, strange to say, by a\\ndisciplined cavalry company of large grim dogs. These, it was observed on the\\npassage, refusing to consort with the emigrants, remained aristocratically\\ngrouped around their master on the elevated quarter-deck, casting disdainful\\nglances forward upon the inferior rabble there; much as, from the ramparts, the\\nsoldiers of a garrison, thrown into a conquered town, eye the inglorious\\ncitizen-mob over which they are set to watch.', 'Now Charles’s Isle not only resembles Barrington Isle in being much more\\ninhabitable than other parts of the group, but it is double the size of\\nBarrington, say forty or fifty miles in circuit.', 'Safely debarked at last, the company, under direction of their lord and patron,\\nforthwith proceeded to build their capital city. They make considerable advance\\nin the way of walls of clinkers, and lava floors, nicely sanded with cinders.\\nOn the least barren hills they pasture their cattle, while the goats,\\nadventurers by nature, explore the far inland solitudes for a scanty livelihood\\nof lofty herbage. Meantime, abundance of fish and tortoises supply their other\\nwants.', 'The disorders incident to settling all primitive regions, in the present case\\nwere heightened by the peculiarly untoward character of many of the pilgrims.\\nHis Majesty was forced at last to proclaim martial law, and actually hunted and\\nshot with his own hand several of his rebellious subjects, who, with most\\nquestionable intentions, had clandestinely encamped in the interior, whence\\nthey stole by night, to prowl barefooted on tiptoe round the precincts of the\\nlava-palace. It is to be remarked, however, that prior to such stern\\nproceedings, the more reliable men had been judiciously picked out for an\\ninfantry body-guard, subordinate to the cavalry body-guard of dogs. But the\\nstate of politics in this unhappy nation may be somewhat imagined, from the\\ncircumstance that all who were not of the body-guard were downright plotters\\nand malignant traitors. At length the death penalty was tacitly abolished,\\nowing to the timely thought, that were strict sportsman’s justice to be\\ndispensed among such subjects, ere long the Nimrod King would have little or no\\nremaining game to shoot. The human part of the life-guard was now disbanded,\\nand set to work cultivating the soil, and raising potatoes; the regular army\\nnow solely consisting of the dog-regiment. These, as I have heard, were of a\\nsingularly ferocious character, though by severe training rendered docile to\\ntheir master. Armed to the teeth, the Creole now goes in state, surrounded by\\nhis canine janizaries, whose terrific bayings prove quite as serviceable as\\nbayonets in keeping down the surgings of revolt.', 'But the census of the isle, sadly lessened by the dispensation of justice, and\\nnot materially recruited by matrimony, began to fill his mind with sad\\nmistrust. Some way the population must be increased. Now, from its possessing a\\nlittle water, and its comparative pleasantness of aspect, Charles’s Isle\\nat this period was occasionally visited by foreign whalers. These His Majesty\\nhad always levied upon for port charges, thereby contributing to his revenue.\\nBut now he had additional designs. By insidious arts he, from time to time,\\ncajoles certain sailors to desert their ships, and enlist beneath his banner.\\nSoon as missed, their captains crave permission to go and hunt them up.\\nWhereupon His Majesty first hides them very carefully away, and then freely\\npermits the search. In consequence, the delinquents are never found, and the\\nships retire without them.', 'Thus, by a two-edged policy of this crafty monarch, foreign nations were\\ncrippled in the number of their subjects, and his own were greatly multiplied.\\nHe particularly petted these renegado strangers. But alas for the deep-laid\\nschemes of ambitious princes, and alas for the vanity of glory. As the\\nforeign-born Pretorians, unwisely introduced into the Roman state, and still\\nmore unwisely made favorites of the Emperors, at last insulted and overturned\\nthe throne, even so these lawless mariners, with all the rest of the body-guard\\nand all the populace, broke out into a terrible mutiny, and defied their\\nmaster. He marched against them with all his dogs. A deadly battle ensued upon\\nthe beach. It raged for three hours, the dogs fighting with determined valor,\\nand the sailors reckless of everything but victory. Three men and thirteen dogs\\nwere left dead upon the field, many on both sides were wounded, and the king\\nwas forced to fly with the remainder of his canine regiment. The enemy pursued,\\nstoning the dogs with their master into the wilderness of the interior.\\nDiscontinuing the pursuit, the victors returned to the village on the shore,\\nstove the spirit casks, and proclaimed a Republic. The dead men were interred\\nwith the honors of war, and the dead dogs ignominiously thrown into the sea. At\\nlast, forced by stress of suffering, the fugitive Creole came down from the\\nhills and offered to treat for peace. But the rebels refused it on any other\\nterms than his unconditional banishment. Accordingly, the next ship that\\narrived carried away the ex-king to Peru.', 'The history of the king of Charles’s Island furnishes another\\nillustration of the difficulty of colonizing barren islands with unprincipled\\npilgrims.', 'Doubtless for a long time the exiled monarch, pensively ruralizing in Peru,\\nwhich afforded him a safe asylum in his calamity, watched every arrival from\\nthe Encantadas, to hear news of the failure of the Republic, the consequent\\npenitence of the rebels, and his own recall to royalty. Doubtless he deemed the\\nRepublic but a miserable experiment which would soon explode. But no, the\\ninsurgents had confederated themselves into a democracy neither Grecian, Roman,\\nnor American. Nay, it was no democracy at all, but a permanent\\nRiotocracy, which gloried in having no law but lawlessness. Great\\ninducements being offered to deserters, their ranks were swelled by accessions\\nof scamps from every ship which touched their shores. Charles’s Island\\nwas proclaimed the asylum of the oppressed of all navies. Each runaway tar was\\nhailed as a martyr in the cause of freedom, and became immediately installed a\\nragged citizen of this universal nation. In vain the captains of absconding\\nseamen strove to regain them. Their new compatriots were ready to give any\\nnumber of ornamental eyes in their behalf. They had few cannon, but their fists\\nwere not to be trifled with. So at last it came to pass that no vessels\\nacquainted with the character of that country durst touch there, however sorely\\nin want of refreshment. It became Anathema—a sea Alsatia—the\\nunassailed lurking-place of all sorts of desperadoes, who in the name of\\nliberty did just what they pleased. They continually fluctuated in their\\nnumbers. Sailors, deserting ships at other islands, or in boats at sea anywhere\\nin that vicinity, steered for Charles’s Isle, as to their sure home of\\nrefuge; while, sated with the life of the isle, numbers from time to time\\ncrossed the water to the neighboring ones, and there presenting themselves to\\nstrange captains as shipwrecked seamen, often succeeded in getting on board\\nvessels bound to the Spanish coast, and having a compassionate purse made up\\nfor them on landing there.', 'One warm night during my first visit to the group, our ship was floating along\\nin languid stillness, when some one on the forecastle shouted “Light\\nho!” We looked and saw a beacon burning on some obscure land off the\\nbeam. Our third mate was not intimate with this part of the world. Going to the\\ncaptain he said, “Sir, shall I put off in a boat? These must be\\nshipwrecked men.”', 'The captain laughed rather grimly, as, shaking his fist towards the beacon, he\\nrapped out an oath, and said—“No, no, you precious rascals, you\\ndon’t juggle one of my boats ashore this blessed night. You do well, you\\nthieves—you do benevolently to hoist a light yonder as on a dangerous\\nshoal.

Two days had been spent ashore in\\nhunting tortoises. There was not time to capture many; so on the third\\nafternoon we loosed our sails. We were just in the act of getting under way,\\nthe uprooted anchor yet suspended and invisibly swaying beneath the wave, as\\nthe good ship gradually turned her heel to leave the isle behind, when the\\nseaman who heaved with me at the windlass paused suddenly, and directed my\\nattention to something moving on the land, not along the beach, but somewhat\\nback, fluttering from a height.', 'In view of the sequel of this little story, be it here narrated how it came to\\npass, that an object which partly from its being so small was quite lost to\\nevery other man on board, still caught the eye of my handspike companion. The\\nrest of the crew, myself included, merely stood up to our spikes in heaving,\\nwhereas, unwontedly exhilarated, at every turn of the ponderous windlass, my\\nbelted comrade leaped atop of it, with might and main giving a downward,\\nthewey, perpendicular heave, his raised eye bent in cheery animation upon the\\nslowly receding shore. Being high lifted above all others was the reason he\\nperceived the object, otherwise unperceivable; and this elevation of his eye\\nwas owing to the elevation of his spirits; and this again—for truth must\\nout—to a dram of Peruvian pisco, in guerdon for some kindness done,\\nsecretly administered to him that morning by our mulatto steward. Now,\\ncertainly, pisco does a deal of mischief in the world; yet seeing that, in the\\npresent case, it was the means, though indirect, of rescuing a human being from\\nthe most dreadful fate, must we not also needs admit that sometimes pisco does\\na deal of good?', 'Glancing across the water in the direction pointed out, I saw some white thing\\nhanging from an inland rock, perhaps half a mile from the sea.', '“It is a bird; a white-winged bird; perhaps a—no; it is—it is\\na handkerchief!”', '“Ay, a handkerchief!” echoed my comrade, and with a louder shout\\napprised the captain.', 'Quickly now—like the running out and training of a great gun—the\\nlong cabin spy-glass was thrust through the mizzen rigging from the high\\nplatform of the poop; whereupon a human figure was plainly seen upon the inland\\nrock, eagerly waving towards us what seemed to be the handkerchief.', 'Our captain was a prompt, good fellow. Dropping the glass, he lustily ran\\nforward, ordering the anchor to be dropped again; hands to stand by a boat, and\\nlower away.', 'In a half-hour’s time the swift boat returned. It went with six and came\\nwith seven; and the seventh was a woman.', 'It is not artistic heartlessness, but I wish I could but draw in crayons; for\\nthis woman was a most touching sight; and crayons, tracing softly melancholy\\nlines, would best depict the mournful image of the dark-damasked Chola widow.', 'Her story was soon told, and though given in her own strange language was as\\nquickly understood; for our captain, from long trading on the Chilian coast,\\nwas well versed in the Spanish. A Cholo, or half-breed Indian woman of Payta in\\nPeru, three years gone by, with her young new-wedded husband Felipe, of pure\\nCastilian blood, and her one only Indian brother, Truxill, Hunilla had taken\\npassage on the main in a French whaler, commanded by a joyous man; which\\nvessel, bound to the cruising grounds beyond the Enchanted Isles, proposed\\npassing close by their vicinity. The object of the little party was to procure\\ntortoise oil, a fluid which for its great purity and delicacy is held in high\\nestimation wherever known; and it is well known all along this part of the\\nPacific coast. With a chest of clothes, tools, cooking utensils, a rude\\napparatus for trying out the oil, some casks of biscuit, and other things, not\\nomitting two favorite dogs, of which faithful animal all the Cholos are very\\nfond, Hunilla and her companions were safely landed at their chosen place; the\\nFrenchman, according to the contract made ere sailing, engaged to take them off\\nupon returning from a four months’ cruise in the westward seas; which\\ninterval the three adventurers deemed quite sufficient for their purposes.', 'On the isle’s lone beach they paid him in silver for their passage out,\\nthe stranger having declined to carry them at all except upon that condition;\\nthough willing to take every means to insure the due fulfillment of his\\npromise. Felipe had striven hard to have this payment put off to the period of\\nthe ship’s return. But in vain. Still they thought they had, in another\\nway, ample pledge of the good faith of the Frenchman. It was arranged that the\\nexpenses of the passage home should not be payable in silver, but in tortoises;\\none hundred tortoises ready captured to the returning captain’s hand.\\nThese the Cholos meant to secure after their own work was done, against the\\nprobable time of the Frenchman’s coming back; and no doubt in prospect\\nalready felt, that in those hundred tortoises—now somewhere ranging the\\nisle’s interior—they possessed one hundred hostages. Enough: the\\nvessel sailed; the gazing three on shore answered the loud glee of the singing\\ncrew; and ere evening, the French craft was hull down in the distant sea, its\\nmasts three faintest lines which quickly faded from Hunilla’s eye.', 'The stranger had given a blithesome promise, and anchored it with oaths; but\\noaths and anchors equally will drag; naught else abides on fickle earth but\\nunkept promises of joy. Contrary winds from out unstable skies, or contrary\\nmoods of his more varying mind, or shipwreck and sudden death in solitary\\nwaves; whatever was the cause, the blithe stranger never was seen again.', 'Yet, however dire a calamity was here in store, misgivings of it ere due time\\nnever disturbed the Cholos’ busy mind, now all intent upon the toilsome\\nmatter which had brought them hither. Nay, by swift doom coming like the thief\\nat night, ere seven weeks went by, two of the little party were removed from\\nall anxieties of land or sea. No more they sought to gaze with feverish fear,\\nor still more feverish hope, beyond the present’s horizon line; but into\\nthe furthest future their own silent spirits sailed. By persevering labor\\nbeneath that burning sun, Felipe and Truxill had brought down to their hut many\\nscores of tortoises, and tried out the oil, when, elated with their good\\nsuccess, and to reward themselves for such hard work, they, too hastily, made a\\ncatamaran, or Indian raft, much used on the Spanish main, and merrily started\\non a fishing trip, just without a long reef with many jagged gaps, running\\nparallel with the shore, about half a mile from it. By some bad tide or hap, or\\nnatural negligence of joyfulness (for though they could not be heard, yet by\\ntheir gestures they seemed singing at the time) forced in deep water against\\nthat iron bar, the ill-made catamaran was overset, and came all to pieces; when\\ndashed by broad-chested swells between their broken logs and the sharp teeth of\\nthe reef, both adventurers perished before Hunilla’s eyes.', 'Before Hunilla’s eyes they sank. The real woe of this event passed before\\nher sight as some sham tragedy on the stage. She was seated on a rude bower\\namong the withered thickets, crowning a lofty cliff, a little back from the\\nbeach. The thickets were so disposed, that in looking upon the sea at large she\\npeered out from among the branches as from the lattice of a high balcony. But\\nupon the day we speak of here, the better to watch the adventure of those two\\nhearts she loved, Hunilla had withdrawn the branches to one side, and held them\\nso. They formed an oval frame, through which the bluely boundless sea rolled\\nlike a painted one. And there, the invisible painter painted to her view the\\nwave-tossed and disjointed raft, its once level logs slantingly upheaved, as\\nraking masts, and the four struggling arms indistinguishable among them; and\\nthen all subsided into smooth-flowing creamy waters, slowly drifting the\\nsplintered wreck; while first and last, no sound of any sort was heard. Death\\nin a silent picture; a dream of the eye; such vanishing shapes as the mirage\\nshows.', 'So instant was the scene, so trance-like its mild pictorial effect, so distant\\nfrom her blasted bower and her common sense of things, that Hunilla gazed and\\ngazed, nor raised a finger or a wail. But as good to sit thus dumb, in stupor\\nstaring on that dumb show, for all that otherwise might be done. With half a\\nmile of sea between, how could her two enchanted arms aid those four fated\\nones? The distance long, the time one sand. After the lightning is beheld, what\\nfool shall stay the thunder-bolt? Felipe’s body was washed ashore, but\\nTruxill’s never came; only his gay, braided hat of golden\\nstraw—that same sunflower thing he waved to her, pushing from the\\nstrand—and now, to the last gallant, it still saluted her. But\\nFelipe’s body floated to the marge, with one arm encirclingly\\noutstretched. Lock-jawed in grim death, the lover-husband softly clasped his\\nbride, true to her even in death’s dream. Ah, heaven, when man thus keeps\\nhis faith, wilt thou be faithless who created the faithful one? But they cannot\\nbreak faith who never plighted it.', 'It needs not to be said what nameless misery now wrapped the lonely widow. In\\ntelling her own story she passed this almost entirely over, simply recounting\\nthe event. Construe the comment of her features as you might, from her mere\\nwords little would you have weened that Hunilla was herself the heroine of her\\ntale. But not thus did she defraud us of our tears. All hearts bled that grief\\ncould be so brave.', 'She but showed us her soul’s lid, and the strange ciphers thereon\\nengraved; all within, with pride’s timidity, was withheld. Yet was there\\none exception. Holding out her small olive hand before her captain, she said in\\nmild and slowest Spanish, “Señor, I buried him;” then paused,\\nstruggled as against the writhed coilings of a snake, and cringing suddenly,\\nleaped up, repeating in impassioned pain, “I buried him, my life, my\\nsoul!”', 'Doubtless, it was by half-unconscious, automatic motions of her hands, that\\nthis heavy-hearted one performed the final office for Felipe, and planted a\\nrude cross of withered sticks—no green ones might be had—at the\\nhead of that lonely grave, where rested now in lasting un-complaint and quiet\\nhaven he whom untranquil seas had overthrown.', 'But some dull sense of another body that should be interred, of another cross\\nthat should hallow another grave—unmade as yet—some dull anxiety\\nand pain touching her undiscovered brother, now haunted the oppressed Hunilla.\\nHer hands fresh from the burial earth, she slowly went back to the beach, with\\nunshaped purposes wandering there, her spell-bound eye bent upon the incessant\\nwaves. But they bore nothing to her but a dirge, which maddened her to think\\nthat murderers should mourn. As time went by, and these things came less\\ndreamingly to her mind, the strong persuasions of her Romish faith, which sets\\npeculiar store by consecrated urns, prompted her to resume in waking earnest\\nthat pious search which had but been begun as in somnambulism. Day after day,\\nweek after week, she trod the cindery beach, till at length a double motive\\nedged every eager glance. With equal longing she now looked for the living and\\nthe dead; the brother and the captain; alike vanished, never to return. Little\\naccurate note of time had Hunilla taken under such emotions as were hers, and\\nlittle, outside herself, served for calendar or dial. As to poor Crusoe in the\\nself-same sea, no saint’s bell pealed forth the lapse of week or month;\\neach day went by unchallenged; no chanticleer announced those sultry dawns, no\\nlowing herds those poisonous nights. All wonted and steadily recurring sounds,\\nhuman, or humanized by sweet fellowship with man, but one stirred that torrid\\ntrance—the cry of dogs; save which naught but the rolling sea invaded it,\\nan all-pervading monotone; and to the widow that was the least loved voice she\\ncould have heard.', 'No wonder, that as her thoughts now wandered to the unreturning ship, and were\\nbeaten back again, the hope against hope so struggled in her soul, that at\\nlength she desperately said, “Not yet, not yet; my foolish heart runs on\\ntoo fast.” So she forced patience for some further weeks. But to those\\nwhom earth’s sure indraft draws, patience or impatience is still the\\nsame.', 'Hunilla now sought to settle precisely in her mind, to an hour, how long it was\\nsince the ship had sailed; and then, with the same precision, how long a space\\nremained to pass. But this proved impossible. What present day or month it was\\nshe could not say. Time was her labyrinth, in which Hunilla was entirely lost.', 'And now follows—', 'Against my own purposes a pause descends upon me here. One knows not whether\\nnature doth not impose some secrecy upon him who has been privy to certain\\nthings. At least, it is to be doubted whether it be good to blazon such. If\\nsome books are deemed most baneful and their sale forbid, how, then, with\\ndeadlier facts, not dreams of doting men? Those whom books will hurt will not\\nbe proof against events. Events, not books, should be forbid. But in all things\\nman sows upon the wind, which bloweth just there whither it listeth; for ill or\\ngood, man cannot know. Often ill comes from the good, as good from ill.', 'When Hunilla—', 'Dire sight it is to see some silken beast long dally with a golden lizard ere\\nshe devour. More terrible, to see how feline Fate will sometimes dally with a\\nhuman soul, and by a nameless magic make it repulse a sane despair with a hope\\nwhich is but mad. Unwittingly I imp this cat-like thing, sporting with the\\nheart of him who reads; for if he feel not he reads in vain.', '—“The ship sails this day, to-day,” at last said Hunilla to\\nherself; “this gives me certain time to stand on; without certainty I go\\nmad. In loose ignorance I have hoped and hoped; now in firm knowledge I will\\nbut wait. Now I live and no longer perish in bewilderings. Holy Virgin, aid me!\\nThou wilt waft back the ship. Oh, past length of weary weeks—all to be\\ndragged over—to buy the certainty of to-day, I freely give ye, though I\\ntear ye from me!”', 'As mariners, tost in tempest on some desolate ledge, patch them a boat out of\\nthe remnants of their vessel’s wreck, and launch it in the self-same\\nwaves, see here Hunilla, this lone shipwrecked soul, out of treachery invoking\\ntrust. Humanity, thou strong thing, I worship thee, not in the laureled victor,\\nbut in this vanquished one.', 'Truly Hunilla leaned upon a reed, a real one; no metaphor; a real Eastern reed.\\nA piece of hollow cane, drifted from unknown isles, and found upon the beach,\\nits once jagged ends rubbed smoothly even as by sand-paper; its golden glazing\\ngone. Long ground between the sea and land, upper and nether stone, the\\nunvarnished substance was filed bare, and wore another polish now, one with\\nitself, the polish of its agony. Circular lines at intervals cut all round this\\nsurface, divided it into six panels of unequal length. In the first were scored\\nthe days, each tenth one marked by a longer and deeper notch; the second was\\nscored for the number of sea-fowl eggs for sustenance, picked out from the\\nrocky nests; the third, how many fish had been caught from the shore; the\\nfourth, how many small tortoises found inland; the fifth, how many days of sun;\\nthe sixth, of clouds; which last, of the two, was the greater one. Long night\\nof busy numbering, misery’s mathematics, to weary her too-wakeful soul to\\nsleep; yet sleep for that was none.', 'The panel of the days was deeply worn—the long tenth notches half\\neffaced, as alphabets of the blind. Ten thousand times the longing widow had\\ntraced her finger over the bamboo—dull flute, which played, on, gave no\\nsound—as if counting birds flown by in air would hasten tortoises\\ncreeping through the woods.', 'After the one hundred and eightieth day no further mark was seen; that last one\\nwas the faintest, as the first the deepest.', '“There were more days,” said our Captain; “many, many more;\\nwhy did you not go on and notch them, too, Hunilla?”', '“Señor, ask me not.”', '“And meantime, did no other vessel pass the isle?”', '“Nay, Señor;—but—”', '“You do not speak; but what, Hunilla?”', '“Ask me not, Señor.”', '“You saw ships pass, far away; you waved to them; they passed\\non;—was that it, Hunilla?”', '“Señor, be it as you say.”', 'Braced against her woe, Hunilla would not, durst not trust the weakness of her\\ntongue. Then when our Captain asked whether any whale-boats had—', 'But no, I will not file this thing complete for scoffing souls to quote, and\\ncall it firm proof upon their side. The half shall here remain untold. Those\\ntwo unnamed events which befell Hunilla on this isle, let them abide between\\nher and her God. In nature, as in law, it may be libelous to speak some truths.', 'Still, how it was that, although our vessel had lain three days anchored nigh\\nthe isle, its one human tenant should not have discovered us till just upon the\\npoint of sailing, never to revisit so lone and far a spot, this needs\\nexplaining ere the sequel come.', 'The place where the French captain had landed the little party was on the\\nfurther and opposite end of the isle. There, too, it was that they had\\nafterwards built their hut. Nor did the widow in her solitude desert the spot\\nwhere her loved ones had dwelt with her, and where the dearest of the twain now\\nslept his last long sleep, and all her plaints awaked him not, and he of\\nhusbands the most faithful during life.', 'Now, high, broken land rises between the opposite extremities of the isle. A\\nship anchored at one side is invisible from the other. Neither is the isle so\\nsmall, but a considerable company might wander for days through the wilderness\\nof one side, and never be seen, or their halloos heard, by any stranger holding\\naloof on the other. Hence Hunilla, who naturally associated the possible coming\\nof ships with her own part of the isle, might to the end have remained quite\\nignorant of the presence of our vessel, were it not for a mysterious\\npresentiment, borne to her, so our mariners averred, by this isle’s\\nenchanted air. Nor did the widow’s answer undo the thought.', '“How did you come to cross the isle this morning, then, Hunilla?”\\nsaid our Captain.', '“Señor, something came flitting by me. It touched my cheek, my heart,\\nSeñor.”', '“What do you say, Hunilla?”', '“I have said, Señor, something came through the air.”', 'It was a narrow chance. For when in crossing the isle Hunilla gained the high\\nland in the centre, she must then for the first have perceived our masts, and\\nalso marked that their sails were being loosed, perhaps even heard the echoing\\nchorus of the windlass song. The strange ship was about to sail, and she\\nbehind. With all haste she now descends the height on the hither side, but soon\\nloses sight of the ship among the sunken jungles at the mountain’s base.\\nShe struggles on through the withered branches, which seek at every step to bar\\nher path, till she comes to the isolated rock, still some way from the water.\\nThis she climbs, to reassure herself. The ship is still in plainest sight. But\\nnow, worn out with over tension, Hunilla all but faints; she fears to step down\\nfrom her giddy perch; she is fain to pause, there where she is, and as a last\\nresort catches the turban from her head, unfurls and waves it over the jungles\\ntowards us.', 'During the telling of her story the mariners formed a voiceless circle round\\nHunilla and the Captain; and when at length the word was given to man the\\nfastest boat, and pull round to the isle’s thither side, to bring away\\nHunilla’s chest and the tortoise-oil, such alacrity of both cheery and\\nsad obedience seldom before was seen. Little ado was made. Already the anchor\\nhad been recommitted to the bottom, and the ship swung calmly to it.', 'But Hunilla insisted upon accompanying the boat as indispensable pilot to her\\nhidden hut. So being refreshed with the best the steward could supply, she\\nstarted with us. Nor did ever any wife of the most famous admiral, in her\\nhusband’s barge, receive more silent reverence of respect than poor\\nHunilla from this boat’s crew.', 'Rounding many a vitreous cape and bluff, in two hours’ time we shot\\ninside the fatal reef; wound into a secret cove, looked up along a green\\nmany-gabled lava wall, and saw the island’s solitary dwelling.', 'It hung upon an impending cliff, sheltered on two sides by tangled thickets,\\nand half-screened from view in front by juttings of the rude stairway, which\\nclimbed the precipice from the sea. Built of canes, it was thatched with long,\\nmildewed grass. It seemed an abandoned hay-rick, whose haymakers were now no\\nmore. The roof inclined but one way; the eaves coming to within two feet of the\\nground. And here was a simple apparatus to collect the dews, or rather\\ndoubly-distilled and finest winnowed rains, which, in mercy or in mockery, the\\nnight-skies sometimes drop upon these blighted Encantadas. All along beneath\\nthe eaves, a spotted sheet, quite weather-stained, was spread, pinned to short,\\nupright stakes, set in the shallow sand. A small clinker, thrown into the\\ncloth, weighed its middle down, thereby straining all moisture into a calabash\\nplaced below. This vessel supplied each drop of water ever drunk upon the isle\\nby the Cholos. Hunilla told us the calabash, would sometimes, but not often, be\\nhalf filled overnight. It held six quarts, perhaps. “But,” said\\nshe, “we were used to thirst. At sandy Payta, where I live, no shower\\nfrom heaven ever fell; all the water there is brought on mules from the inland\\nvales.”', 'Tied among the thickets were some twenty moaning tortoises, supplying\\nHunilla’s lonely larder; while hundreds of vast tableted black bucklers,\\nlike displaced, shattered tomb-stones of dark slate, were also scattered round.\\nThese were the skeleton backs of those great tortoises from which Felipe and\\nTruxill had made their precious oil. Several large calabashes and two goodly\\nkegs were filled with it. In a pot near by were the caked crusts of a quantity\\nwhich had been permitted to evaporate. “They meant to have strained it\\noff next day,” said Hunilla, as she turned aside.', 'I forgot to mention the most singular sight of all, though the first that\\ngreeted us after landing.', 'Some ten small, soft-haired, ringleted dogs, of a beautiful breed, peculiar to\\nPeru, set up a concert of glad welcomings when we gained the beach, which was\\nresponded to by Hunilla. Some of these dogs had, since her widowhood, been born\\nupon the isle, the progeny of the two brought from Payta. Owing to the jagged\\nsteeps and pitfalls, tortuous thickets, sunken clefts and perilous intricacies\\nof all sorts in the interior, Hunilla, admonished by the loss of one favorite\\namong them, never allowed these delicate creatures to follow her in her\\noccasional birds’-nests climbs and other wanderings; so that, through\\nlong habituation, they offered not to follow, when that morning she crossed the\\nland, and her own soul was then too full of other things to heed their\\nlingering behind. Yet, all along she had so clung to them, that, besides what\\nmoisture they lapped up at early daybreak from the small scoop-holes among the\\nadjacent rocks, she had shared the dew of her calabash among them; never laying\\nby any considerable store against those prolonged and utter droughts which, in\\nsome disastrous seasons, warp these isles.', 'Having pointed out, at our desire, what few things she would like transported\\nto the ship—her chest, the oil, not omitting the live tortoises which she\\nintended for a grateful present to our Captain—we immediately set to\\nwork, carrying them to the boat down the long, sloping stair of deeply-shadowed\\nrock. While my comrades were thus employed, I looked and Hunilla had\\ndisappeared.', 'It was not curiosity alone, but, it seems to me, something different mingled\\nwith it, which prompted me to drop my tortoise, and once more gaze slowly\\naround. I remembered the husband buried by Hunilla’s hands. A narrow\\npathway led into a dense part of the thickets. Following it through many mazes,\\nI came out upon a small, round, open space, deeply chambered there.', 'The mound rose in the middle; a bare heap of finest sand, like that unverdured\\nheap found at the bottom of an hour-glass run out. At its head stood the cross\\nof withered sticks; the dry, peeled bark still fraying from it; its transverse\\nlimb tied up with rope, and forlornly adroop in the silent air.', 'Hunilla was partly prostrate upon the grave; her dark head bowed, and lost in\\nher long, loosened Indian hair; her hands extended to the cross-foot, with a\\nlittle brass crucifix clasped between; a crucifix worn featureless, like an\\nancient graven knocker long plied in vain. She did not see me, and I made no\\nnoise, but slid aside, and left the spot.', 'A few moments ere all was ready for our going, she reappeared among us. I\\nlooked into her eyes, but saw no tear. There was something which seemed\\nstrangely haughty in her air, and yet it was the air of woe. A Spanish and an\\nIndian grief, which would not visibly lament. Pride’s height in vain\\nabased to proneness on the rack; nature’s pride subduing nature’s\\ntorture.', 'Like pages the small and silken dogs surrounded her, as she slowly descended\\ntowards the beach. She caught the two most eager creatures in her\\narms:—“Mia Teeta! Mia Tomoteeta!” and fondling them, inquired\\nhow many could we take on board.', 'The mate commanded the boat’s crew; not a hard-hearted man, but his way\\nof life had been such that in most things, even in the smallest, simple utility\\nwas his leading motive.', '“We cannot take them all, Hunilla; our supplies are short; the winds are\\nunreliable; we may be a good many days going to Tombez. So take those you have,\\nHunilla; but no more.”', 'She was in the boat; the oarsmen, too, were seated; all save one, who stood\\nready to push off and then spring himself. With the sagacity of their race, the\\ndogs now seemed aware that they were in the very instant of being deserted upon\\na barren strand. The gunwales of the boat were high; its prow—presented\\ninland—was lifted; so owing to the water, which they seemed instinctively\\nto shun, the dogs could not well leap into the little craft. But their busy\\npaws hard scraped the prow, as it had been some farmer’s door shutting\\nthem out from shelter in a winter storm. A clamorous agony of alarm. They did\\nnot howl, or whine; they all but spoke.', '“Push off! Give way!” cried the mate. The boat gave one heavy drag\\nand lurch, and next moment shot swiftly from the beach, turned on her heel, and\\nsped. The dogs ran howling along the water’s marge; now pausing to gaze\\nat the flying boat, then motioning as if to leap in chase, but mysteriously\\nwithheld themselves; and again ran howling along the beach. Had they been human\\nbeings, hardly would they have more vividly inspired the sense of desolation.\\nThe oars were plied as confederate feathers of two wings. No one spoke. I\\nlooked back upon the beach, and then upon Hunilla, but her face was set in a\\nstern dusky calm. The dogs crouching in her lap vainly licked her rigid hands.\\nShe never looked behind her: but sat motionless, till we turned a promontory of\\nthe coast and lost all sights and sounds astern. She seemed as one who, having\\nexperienced the sharpest of mortal pangs, was henceforth content to have all\\nlesser heartstrings riven, one by one. To Hunilla, pain seemed so necessary,\\nthat pain in other beings, though by love and sympathy made her own, was\\nunrepiningly to be borne. A heart of yearning in a frame of steel. A heart of\\nearthly yearning, frozen by the frost which falleth from the sky.', 'The sequel is soon told. After a long passage, vexed by calms and baffling\\nwinds, we made the little port of Tombez in Peru, there to recruit the ship.\\nPayta was not very distant. Our captain sold the tortoise oil to a Tombez\\nmerchant; and adding to the silver a contribution from all hands, gave it to\\nour silent passenger, who knew not what the mariners had done.', 'The last seen of lone Hunilla she was passing into Payta town, riding upon a\\nsmall gray ass; and before her on the ass’s shoulders, she eyed the\\njointed workings of the beast’s armorial cross.', '“That darkesome glen they enter, where they find\\nThat cursed man low sitting on the ground,\\nMusing full sadly in his sullein mind;\\nHis griesly lockes long gronen and unbound,\\nDisordered hong about his shoulders round,\\nAnd hid his face, through which his hollow eyne\\nLookt deadly dull, and stared as astound;\\nHis raw-bone cheekes, through penurie and pine,\\nWere shronke into the jawes, as he did never dine.\\nHis garments nought but many ragged clouts,\\nWith thornes together pind and patched reads,\\nThe which his naked sides he wrapt abouts.”', 'Southeast of Crossman’s Isle lies Hood’s Isle, or McCain’s\\nBeclouded Isle; and upon its south side is a vitreous cove with a wide strand\\nof dark pounded black lava, called Black Beach, or Oberlus’s Landing. It\\nmight fitly have been styled Charon’s.', 'It received its name from a wild white creature who spent many years here; in\\nthe person of a European bringing into this savage region qualities more\\ndiabolical than are to be found among any of the surrounding cannibals.', 'About half a century ago, Oberlus deserted at the above-named island, then, as\\nnow, a solitude. He built himself a den of lava and clinkers, about a mile from\\nthe Landing, subsequently called after him, in a vale, or expanded gulch,\\ncontaining here and there among the rocks about two acres of soil capable of\\nrude cultivation; the only place on the isle not too blasted for that purpose.\\nHere he succeeded in raising a sort of degenerate potatoes and pumpkins, which\\nfrom time to time he exchanged with needy whalemen passing, for spirits or\\ndollars.', 'His appearance, from all accounts, was that of the victim of some malignant\\nsorceress; he seemed to have drunk of Circe’s cup; beast-like; rags\\ninsufficient to hide his nakedness; his befreckled skin blistered by continual\\nexposure to the sun; nose flat; countenance contorted, heavy, earthy; hair and\\nbeard unshorn, profuse, and of fiery red. He struck strangers much as if he\\nwere a volcanic creature thrown up by the same convulsion which exploded into\\nsight the isle. All bepatched and coiled asleep in his lonely lava den among\\nthe mountains, he looked, they say, as a heaped drift of withered leaves, torn\\nfrom autumn trees, and so left in some hidden nook by the whirling halt for an\\ninstant of a fierce night-wind, which then ruthlessly sweeps on, somewhere else\\nto repeat the capricious act. It is also reported to have been the strangest\\nsight, this same Oberlus, of a sultry, cloudy morning, hidden under his\\nshocking old black tarpaulin hat, hoeing potatoes among the lava. So warped and\\ncrooked was his strange nature, that the very handle of his hoe seemed\\ngradually to have shrunk and twisted in his grasp, being a wretched bent stick,\\nelbowed more like a savage’s war-sickle than a civilized hoe-handle. It\\nwas his mysterious custom upon a first encounter with a stranger ever to\\npresent his back; possibly, because that was his better side, since it revealed\\nthe least. If the encounter chanced in his garden, as it sometimes\\ndid—the new-landed strangers going from the sea-side straight through the\\ngorge, to hunt up the queer green-grocer reported doing business\\nhere—Oberlus for a time hoed on, unmindful of all greeting, jovial or\\nbland; as the curious stranger would turn to face him, the recluse, hoe in\\nhand, as diligently would avert himself; bowed over, and sullenly revolving\\nround his murphy hill. Thus far for hoeing. When planting, his whole aspect and\\nall his gestures were so malevolently and uselessly sinister and secret, that\\nhe seemed rather in act of dropping poison into wells than potatoes into soil.\\nBut among his lesser and more harmless marvels was an idea he ever had, that\\nhis visitors came equally as well led by longings to behold the mighty hermit\\nOberlus in his royal state of solitude, as simply, to obtain potatoes, or find\\nwhatever company might be upon a barren isle. It seems incredible that such a\\nbeing should possess such vanity; a misanthrope be conceited; but he really had\\nhis notion; and upon the strength of it, often gave himself amusing airs to\\ncaptains. But after all, this is somewhat of a piece with the well-known\\neccentricity of some convicts, proud of that very hatefulness which makes them\\nnotorious. At other times, another unaccountable whim would seize him, and he\\nwould long dodge advancing strangers round the clinkered corners of his hut;\\nsometimes like a stealthy bear, he would slink through the withered thickets up\\nthe mountains, and refuse to see the human face.', 'Except his occasional visitors from the sea, for a long period, the only\\ncompanions of Oberlus were the crawling tortoises; and he seemed more than\\ndegraded to their level, having no desires for a time beyond theirs, unless it\\nwere for the stupor brought on by drunkenness. But sufficiently debased as he\\nappeared, there yet lurked in him, only awaiting occasion for discovery, a\\nstill further proneness. Indeed, the sole superiority of Oberlus over the\\ntortoises was his possession of a larger capacity of degradation; and along\\nwith that, something like an intelligent will to it. Moreover, what is about to\\nbe revealed, perhaps will show, that selfish ambition, or the love of rule for\\nits own sake, far from being the peculiar infirmity of noble minds, is shared\\nby beings which have no mind at all. No creatures are so selfishly tyrannical\\nas some brutes; as any one who has observed the tenants of the pasture must\\noccasionally have observed.', '“This island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,” said Oberlus to\\nhimself, glaring round upon his haggard solitude. By some means, barter or\\ntheft—for in those days ships at intervals still kept touching at his\\nLanding—he obtained an old musket, with a few charges of powder and ball.\\nPossessed of arms, he was stimulated to enterprise, as a tiger that first feels\\nthe coming of its claws. The long habit of sole dominion over every object\\nround him, his almost unbroken solitude, his never encountering humanity except\\non terms of misanthropic independence, or mercantile craftiness, and even such\\nencounters being comparatively but rare; all this must have gradually nourished\\nin him a vast idea of his own importance, together with a pure animal sort of\\nscorn for all the rest of the universe.', 'The unfortunate Creole, who enjoyed his brief term of royalty at\\nCharles’s Isle was perhaps in some degree influenced by not unworthy\\nmotives; such as prompt other adventurous spirits to lead colonists into\\ndistant regions and assume political preeminence over them. His summary\\nexecution of many of his Peruvians is quite pardonable, considering the\\ndesperate characters he had to deal with; while his offering canine battle to\\nthe banded rebels seems under the circumstances altogether just. But for this\\nKing Oberlus and what shortly follows, no shade of palliation can be given. He\\nacted out of mere delight in tyranny and cruelty, by virtue of a quality in him\\ninherited from Sycorax his mother. Armed now with that shocking blunderbuss,\\nstrong in the thought of being master of that horrid isle, he panted for a\\nchance to prove his potency upon the first specimen of humanity which should\\nfall unbefriended into his hands.', 'Nor was he long without it. One day he spied a boat upon the beach, with one\\nman, a negro, standing by it. Some distance off was a ship, and Oberlus\\nimmediately knew how matters stood. The vessel had put in for wood, and the\\nboat’s crew had gone into the thickets for it. From a convenient spot he\\nkept watch of the boat, till presently a straggling company appeared loaded\\nwith billets. Throwing these on the beach, they again went into the thickets,\\nwhile the negro proceeded to load the boat.', 'Oberlus now makes all haste and accosts the negro, who, aghast at seeing any\\nliving being inhabiting such a solitude, and especially so horrific a one,\\nimmediately falls into a panic, not at all lessened by the ursine suavity of\\nOberlus, who begs the favor of assisting him in his labors. The negro stands\\nwith several billets on his shoulder, in act of shouldering others; and\\nOberlus, with a short cord concealed in his bosom, kindly proceeds to lift\\nthose other billets to their place. In so doing, he persists in keeping behind\\nthe negro, who, rightly suspicious of this, in vain dodges about to gain the\\nfront of Oberlus; but Oberlus dodges also; till at last, weary of this bootless\\nattempt at treachery, or fearful of being surprised by the remainder of the\\nparty, Oberlus runs off a little space to a bush, and fetching his blunderbuss,\\nsavagely commands the negro to desist work and follow him. He refuses.\\nWhereupon, presenting his piece, Oberlus snaps at him. Luckily the blunderbuss\\nmisses fire; but by this time, frightened out of his wits, the negro, upon a\\nsecond intrepid summons, drops his billets, surrenders at discretion, and\\nfollows on. By a narrow defile familiar to him, Oberlus speedily removes out of\\nsight of the water.', 'On their way up the mountains, he exultingly informs the negro, that henceforth\\nhe is to work for him, and be his slave, and that his treatment would entirely\\ndepend on his future conduct. But Oberlus, deceived by the first impulsive\\ncowardice of the black, in an evil moment slackens his vigilance. Passing\\nthrough a narrow way, and perceiving his leader quite off his guard, the negro,\\na powerful fellow, suddenly grasps him in his arms, throws him down, wrests his\\nmusketoon from him, ties his hands with the monster’s own cord, shoulders\\nhim, and returns with him down to the boat. When the rest of the party arrive,\\nOberlus is carried on board the ship. This proved an Englishman, and a\\nsmuggler; a sort of craft not apt to be over-charitable. Oberlus is severely\\nwhipped, then handcuffed, taken ashore, and compelled to make known his\\nhabitation and produce his property. His potatoes, pumpkins, and tortoises,\\nwith a pile of dollars he had hoarded from his mercantile operations were\\nsecured on the spot. But while the too vindictive smugglers were busy\\ndestroying his hut and garden, Oberlus makes his escape into the mountains, and\\nconceals himself there in impenetrable recesses, only known to himself, till\\nthe ship sails, when he ventures back, and by means of an old file which he\\nsticks into a tree, contrives to free himself from his handcuffs.', 'Brooding among the ruins of his hut, and the desolate clinkers and extinct\\nvolcanoes of this outcast isle, the insulted misanthrope now meditates a signal\\nrevenge upon humanity, but conceals his purposes. Vessels still touch the\\nLanding at times; and by-and-by Oberlus is enabled to supply them with some\\nvegetables.', 'Warned by his former failure in kidnapping strangers, he now pursues a quite\\ndifferent plan. When seamen come ashore, he makes up to them like a\\nfree-and-easy comrade, invites them to his hut, and with whatever affability\\nhis red-haired grimness may assume, entreats them to drink his liquor and be\\nmerry. But his guests need little pressing; and so, soon as rendered\\ninsensible, are tied hand and foot, and pitched among the clinkers, are there\\nconcealed till the ship departs, when, finding themselves entirely dependent\\nupon Oberlus, alarmed at his changed demeanor, his savage threats, and above\\nall, that shocking blunderbuss, they willingly enlist under him, becoming his\\nhumble slaves, and Oberlus the most incredible of tyrants. So much so, that two\\nor three perish beneath his initiating process. He sets the\\nremainder—four of them—to breaking the caked soil; transporting\\nupon their backs loads of loamy earth, scooped up in moist clefts among the\\nmountains; keeps them on the roughest fare; presents his piece at the slightest\\nhint of insurrection; and in all respects converts them into reptiles at his\\nfeet—plebeian garter-snakes to this Lord Anaconda.', 'At last, Oberlus contrives to stock his arsenal with four rusty cutlasses, and\\nan added supply of powder and ball intended for his blunderbuss. Remitting in\\ngood part the labor of his slaves, he now approves himself a man, or rather\\ndevil, of great abilities in the way of cajoling or coercing others into\\nacquiescence with his own ulterior designs, however at first abhorrent to them.\\nBut indeed, prepared for almost any eventual evil by their previous lawless\\nlife, as a sort of ranging Cow-Boys of the sea, which had dissolved within them\\nthe whole moral man, so that they were ready to concrete in the first offered\\nmould of baseness now; rotted down from manhood by their hopeless misery on the\\nisle; wonted to cringe in all things to their lord, himself the worst of\\nslaves; these wretches were now become wholly corrupted to his hands. He used\\nthem as creatures of an inferior race; in short, he gaffles his four animals,\\nand makes murderers of them; out of cowards fitly manufacturing bravos.', 'Now, sword or dagger, human arms are but artificial claws and fangs, tied on\\nlike false spurs to the fighting cock. So, we repeat, Oberlus, czar of the\\nisle, gaffles his four subjects; that is, with intent of glory, puts four rusty\\ncutlasses into their hands. Like any other autocrat, he had a noble army now.', 'It might be thought a servile war would hereupon ensue. Arms in the hands of\\ntrodden slaves? how indiscreet of Emperor Oberlus! Nay, they had but\\ncutlasses—sad old scythes enough—he a blunderbuss, which by its\\nblind scatterings of all sorts of boulders, clinkers, and other scoria would\\nannihilate all four mutineers, like four pigeons at one shot. Besides, at first\\nhe did not sleep in his accustomed hut; every lurid sunset, for a time, he\\nmight have been seen wending his way among the riven mountains, there to\\nsecrete himself till dawn in some sulphurous pitfall, undiscoverable to his\\ngang; but finding this at last too troublesome, he now each evening tied his\\nslaves hand and foot, hid the cutlasses, and thrusting them into his barracks,\\nshut to the door, and lying down before it, beneath a rude shed lately added,\\nslept out the night, blunderbuss in hand.', 'It is supposed that not content with daily parading over a cindery solitude at\\nthe head of his fine army, Oberlus now meditated the most active mischief; his\\nprobable object being to surprise some passing ship touching at his dominions,\\nmassacre the crew, and run away with her to parts unknown. While these plans\\nwere simmering in his head, two ships touch in company at the isle, on the\\nopposite side to his; when his designs undergo a sudden change.', 'The ships are in want of vegetables, which Oberlus promises in great abundance,\\nprovided they send their boats round to his landing, so that the crews may\\nbring the vegetables from his garden; informing the two captains, at the same\\ntime, that his rascals—slaves and soldiers—had become so abominably\\nlazy and good-for-nothing of late, that he could not make them work by ordinary\\ninducements, and did not have the heart to be severe with them.', 'The arrangement was agreed to, and the boats were sent and hauled upon the\\nbeach. The crews went to the lava hut; but to their surprise nobody was there.\\nAfter waiting till their patience was exhausted, they returned to the shore,\\nwhen lo, some stranger—not the Good Samaritan either—seems to have\\nvery recently passed that way. Three of the boats were broken in a thousand\\npieces, and the fourth was missing. By hard toil over the mountains and through\\nthe clinkers, some of the strangers succeeded in returning to that side of the\\nisle where the ships lay, when fresh boats are sent to the relief of the rest\\nof the hapless party.', 'However amazed at the treachery of Oberlus, the two captains, afraid of new and\\nstill more mysterious atrocities—and indeed, half imputing such strange\\nevents to the enchantments associated with these isles—perceive no\\nsecurity but in instant flight; leaving Oberlus and his army in quiet\\npossession of the stolen boat.', 'On the eve of sailing they put a letter in a keg, giving the Pacific Ocean\\nintelligence of the affair, and moored the keg in the bay. Some time\\nsubsequent, the keg was opened by another captain chancing to anchor there, but\\nnot until after he had dispatched a boat round to Oberlus’s Landing. As\\nmay be readily surmised, he felt no little inquietude till the boat’s\\nreturn: when another letter was handed him, giving Oberlus’s version of\\nthe affair. This precious document had been found pinned half-mildewed to the\\nclinker wall of the sulphurous and deserted hut. It ran as follows: showing\\nthat Oberlus was at least an accomplished writer, and no mere boor; and what is\\nmore, was capable of the most tristful eloquence.', '“Sir: I am the most unfortunate ill-treated gentleman that lives. I am a\\npatriot, exiled from my country by the cruel hand of tyranny.', '“Banished to these Enchanted Isles, I have again and again besought\\ncaptains of ships to sell me a boat, but always have been refused, though I\\noffered the handsomest prices in Mexican dollars. At length an opportunity\\npresented of possessing myself of one, and I did not let it slip.', '“I have been long endeavoring, by hard labor and much solitary suffering,\\nto accumulate something to make myself comfortable in a virtuous though unhappy\\nold age; but at various times have been robbed and beaten by men professing to\\nbe Christians.', '“To-day I sail from the Enchanted group in the good boat Charity bound to\\nthe Feejee Isles.', '“FATHERLESS OBERLUS.', '“P.S.—Behind the clinkers, nigh the oven, you will find the\\nold fowl. Do not kill it; be patient; I leave it setting; if it shall have any\\nchicks, I hereby bequeath them to you, whoever you may be. But don’t\\ncount your chicks before they are hatched.”', 'The fowl proved a starveling rooster, reduced to a sitting posture by sheer\\ndebility.', 'Oberlus declares that he was bound to the Feejee Isles; but this was only to\\nthrow pursuers on a false scent. For, after a long time, he arrived, alone in\\nhis open boat, at Guayaquil. As his miscreants were never again beheld on\\nHood’s Isle, it is supposed, either that they perished for want of water\\non the passage to Guayaquil, or, what is quite as probable, were thrown\\noverboard by Oberlus, when he found the water growing scarce.', 'From Guayaquil Oberlus proceeded to Payta; and there, with that nameless\\nwitchery peculiar to some of the ugliest animals, wound himself into the\\naffections of a tawny damsel; prevailing upon her to accompany him back to his\\nEnchanted Isle; which doubtless he painted as a Paradise of flowers, not a\\nTartarus of clinkers.', 'But unfortunately for the colonization of Hood’s Isle with a choice\\nvariety of animated nature, the extraordinary and devilish aspect of Oberlus\\nmade him to be regarded in Payta as a highly suspicious character. So that\\nbeing found concealed one night, with matches in his pocket, under the hull of\\na small vessel just ready to be launched, he was seized and thrown into jail.', 'The jails in most South American towns are generally of the least wholesome\\nsort. Built of huge cakes of sun-burnt brick, and containing but one room,\\nwithout windows or yard, and but one door heavily grated with wooden bars, they\\npresent both within and without the grimmest aspect. As public edifices they\\nconspicuously stand upon the hot and dusty Plaza, offering to view, through the\\ngratings, their villainous and hopeless inmates, burrowing in all sorts of\\ntragic squalor. And here, for a long time, Oberlus was seen; the central figure\\nof a mongrel and assassin band; a creature whom it is religion to detest, since\\nit is philanthropy to hate a misanthrope.', 'Note.—They who may be disposed to question the possibility of the\\ncharacter above depicted, are referred to the 2d vol. of Porter’s Voyage\\ninto the Pacific, where they will recognize many sentences, for\\nexpedition’s sake derived verbatim from thence, and incorporated here;\\nthe main difference—save a few passing reflections—between the two\\naccounts being, that the present writer has added to Porter’s facts\\naccessory ones picked up in the Pacific from reliable sources; and where facts\\nconflict, has naturally preferred his own authorities to Porter’s. As,\\nfor instance, his authorities place Oberlus on Hood’s Isle:\\nPorter’s, on Charles’s Isle. The letter found in the hut is also\\nsomewhat different; for while at the Encantadas he was informed that, not only\\ndid it evince a certain clerkliness, but was full of the strangest satiric\\neffrontery which does not adequately appear in Porter’s version. I\\naccordingly altered it to suit the general character of its author.', '“And all about old stocks and stubs of trees,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Whereon nor fruit nor leaf was ever seen,\\nDid hang upon ragged knotty knees,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On which had many wretches hanged been.”', 'Some relics of the hut of Oberlus partially remain to this day at the head of\\nthe clinkered valley. Nor does the stranger, wandering among other of the\\nEnchanted Isles, fail to stumble upon still other solitary abodes, long\\nabandoned to the tortoise and the lizard. Probably few parts of earth have, in\\nmodern times, sheltered so many solitaries. The reason is, that these isles are\\nsituated in a distant sea, and the vessels which occasionally visit them are\\nmostly all whalers, or ships bound on dreary and protracted voyages, exempting\\nthem in a good degree from both the oversight and the memory of human law. Such\\nis the character of some commanders and some seamen, that under these untoward\\ncircumstances, it is quite impossible but that scenes of unpleasantness and\\ndiscord should occur between them. A sullen hatred of the tyrannic ship will\\nseize the sailor, and he gladly exchanges it for isles, which, though blighted\\nas by a continual sirocco and burning breeze, still offer him, in their\\nlabyrinthine interior, a retreat beyond the possibility of capture. To flee the\\nship in any Peruvian or Chilian port, even the smallest and most rustical, is\\nnot unattended with great risk of apprehension, not to speak of jaguars. A\\nreward of five pesos sends fifty dastardly Spaniards into the wood, who, with\\nlong knives, scour them day and night in eager hopes of securing their prey.\\nNeither is it, in general, much easier to escape pursuit at the isles of\\nPolynesia. Those of them which have felt a civilizing influence present the\\nsame difficulty to the runaway with the Peruvian ports, the advanced natives\\nbeing quite as mercenary and keen of knife and scent as the retrograde\\nSpaniards; while, owing to the bad odor in which all Europeans lie, in the\\nminds of aboriginal savages who have chanced to hear aught of them, to desert\\nthe ship among primitive Polynesians, is, in most cases, a hope not unforlorn.\\nHence the Enchanted Isles become the voluntary tarrying places of all sorts of\\nrefugees; some of whom too sadly experience the fact, that flight from tyranny\\ndoes not of itself insure a safe asylum, far less a happy home.', 'Moreover, it has not seldom happened that hermits have been made upon the isles\\nby the accidents incident to tortoise-hunting. The interior of most of them is\\ntangled and difficult of passage beyond description; the air is sultry and\\nstifling; an intolerable thirst is provoked, for which no running stream offers\\nits kind relief. In a few hours, under an equatorial sun, reduced by these\\ncauses to entire exhaustion, woe betide the straggler at the Enchanted Isles!\\nTheir extent is such as to forbid an adequate search, unless weeks are devoted\\nto it. The impatient ship waits a day or two; when, the missing man remaining\\nundiscovered, up goes a stake on the beach, with a letter of regret, and a keg\\nof crackers and another of water tied to it, and away sails the craft.', 'Nor have there been wanting instances where the inhumanity of some captains has\\nled them to wreak a secure revenge upon seamen who have given their caprice or\\npride some singular offense. Thrust ashore upon the scorching marl, such\\nmariners are abandoned to perish outright, unless by solitary labors they\\nsucceed in discovering some precious dribblets of moisture oozing from a rock\\nor stagnant in a mountain pool.', 'I was well acquainted with a man, who, lost upon the Isle of Narborough, was\\nbrought to such extremes by thirst, that at last he only saved his life by\\ntaking that of another being. A large hair-seal came upon the beach. He rushed\\nupon it, stabbed it in the neck, and then throwing himself upon the panting\\nbody quaffed at the living wound; the palpitations of the creature’s\\ndying heart injected life into the drinker.', 'Another seaman, thrust ashore in a boat upon an isle at which no ship ever\\ntouched, owing to its peculiar sterility and the shoals about it, and from\\nwhich all other parts of the group were hidden—this man, feeling that it\\nwas sure death to remain there, and that nothing worse than death menaced him\\nin quitting it, killed seals, and inflating their skins, made a float, upon\\nwhich he transported himself to Charles’s Island, and joined the republic\\nthere.', 'But men, not endowed with courage equal to such desperate attempts, find their\\nonly resource in forthwith seeking some watering-place, however precarious or\\nscanty; building a hut; catching tortoises and birds; and in all respects\\npreparing for a hermit life, till tide or time, or a passing ship arrives to\\nfloat them off.', 'At the foot of precipices on many of the isles, small rude basins in the rocks\\nare found, partly filled with rotted rubbish or vegetable decay, or overgrown\\nwith thickets, and sometimes a little moist; which, upon examination, reveal\\nplain tokens of artificial instruments employed in hollowing them out, by some\\npoor castaway or still more miserable runaway. These basins are made in places\\nwhere it was supposed some scanty drops of dew might exude into them from the\\nupper crevices.', 'The relics of hermitages and stone basins are not the only signs of vanishing\\nhumanity to be found upon the isles. And, curious to say, that spot which of\\nall others in settled communities is most animated, at the Enchanted Isles\\npresents the most dreary of aspects. And though it may seem very strange to\\ntalk of post-offices in this barren region, yet post-offices are occasionally\\nto be found there. They consist of a stake and a bottle. The letters being not\\nonly sealed, but corked. They are generally deposited by captains of\\nNantucketers for the benefit of passing fishermen, and contain statements as to\\nwhat luck they had in whaling or tortoise-hunting. Frequently, however, long\\nmonths and months, whole years glide by and no applicant appears. The stake\\nrots and falls, presenting no very exhilarating object.', 'If now it be added that grave-stones, or rather grave-boards, are also\\ndiscovered upon some of the isles, the picture will be complete.', 'Upon the beach of James’s Isle, for many years, was to be seen a rude\\nfinger-post, pointing inland. And, perhaps, taking it for some signal of\\npossible hospitality in this otherwise desolate spot—some good hermit\\nliving there with his maple dish—the stranger would follow on in the path\\nthus indicated, till at last he would come out in a noiseless nook, and find\\nhis only welcome, a dead man—his sole greeting the inscription over a\\ngrave. Here, in 1813, fell, in a daybreak duel, a lieutenant of the U.S.\\nfrigate Essex, aged twenty-one: attaining his majority in death.', 'It is but fit that, like those old monastic institutions of Europe, whose\\ninmates go not out of their own walls to be inurned, but are entombed there\\nwhere they die, the Encantadas, too, should bury their own dead, even as the\\ngreat general monastery of earth does hers.', 'It is known that burial in the ocean is a pure necessity of sea-faring life,\\nand that it is only done when land is far astern, and not clearly visible from\\nthe bow. Hence, to vessels cruising in the vicinity of the Enchanted Isles,\\nthey afford a convenient Potter’s Field. The interment over, some\\ngood-natured forecastle poet and artist seizes his paint-brush, and inscribes a\\ndoggerel epitaph. When, after a long lapse of time, other good-natured seamen\\nchance to come upon the spot, they usually make a table of the mound, and quaff\\na friendly can to the poor soul’s repose.', 'As a specimen of these epitaphs, take the following, found in a bleak gorge of\\nChatham Isle:—', '“Oh, Brother Jack, as you pass by,\\nAs you are now, so once was I.\\nJust so game, and just so gay,\\nBut now, alack, they’ve stopped my pay.\\nNo more I peep out of my blinkers,\\nHere I be—tucked in with clinkers!”', 'In the south of Europe, nigh a once frescoed capital, now with dank mould\\ncankering its bloom, central in a plain, stands what, at distance, seems the\\nblack mossed stump of some immeasurable pine, fallen, in forgotten days, with\\nAnak and the Titan.', 'As all along where the pine tree falls, its dissolution leaves a mossy\\nmound—last-flung shadow of the perished trunk; never lengthening, never\\nlessening; unsubject to the fleet falsities of the sun; shade immutable, and\\ntrue gauge which cometh by prostration—so westward from what seems the\\nstump, one steadfast spear of lichened ruin veins the plain.', 'From that tree-top, what birded chimes of silver throats had rung. A stone\\npine; a metallic aviary in its crown: the Bell-Tower, built by the great\\nmechanician, the unblest foundling, Bannadonna.', 'Like Babel’s, its base was laid in a high hour of renovated earth,\\nfollowing the second deluge, when the waters of the Dark Ages had dried up, and\\nonce more the green appeared. No wonder that, after so long and deep\\nsubmersion, the jubilant expectation of the race should, as with Noah’s\\nsons, soar into Shinar aspiration.', 'In firm resolve, no man in Europe at that period went beyond Bannadonna.\\nEnriched through commerce with the Levant, the state in which he lived voted to\\nhave the noblest Bell-Tower in Italy. His repute assigned him to be architect.', 'Stone by stone, month by month, the tower rose. Higher, higher; snail-like in\\npace, but torch or rocket in its pride.', 'After the masons would depart, the builder, standing alone upon its\\never-ascending summit, at close of every day, saw that he overtopped still\\nhigher walls and trees. He would tarry till a late hour there, wrapped in\\nschemes of other and still loftier piles. Those who of saints’ days\\nthronged the spot—hanging to the rude poles of scaffolding, like sailors\\non yards, or bees on boughs, unmindful of lime and dust, and falling chips of\\nstone—their homage not the less inspirited him to self-esteem.', 'At length the holiday of the Tower came. To the sound of viols, the\\nclimax-stone slowly rose in air, and, amid the firing of ordnance, was laid by\\nBannadonna’s hands upon the final course. Then mounting it, he stood\\nerect, alone, with folded arms, gazing upon the white summits of blue inland\\nAlps, and whiter crests of bluer Alps off-shore—sights invisible from the\\nplain. Invisible, too, from thence was that eye he turned below, when, like the\\ncannon booms, came up to him the people’s combustions of applause.', 'That which stirred them so was, seeing with what serenity the builder stood\\nthree hundred feet in air, upon an unrailed perch. This none but he durst do.\\nBut his periodic standing upon the pile, in each stage of its growth—such\\ndiscipline had its last result.', 'Little remained now but the bells. These, in all respects, must correspond with\\ntheir receptacle.', 'The minor ones were prosperously cast. A highly enriched one followed, of a\\nsingular make, intended for suspension in a manner before unknown. The purpose\\nof this bell, its rotary motion, and connection with the clock-work, also\\nexecuted at the time, will, in the sequel, receive mention.', 'In the one erection, bell-tower and clock-tower were united, though, before\\nthat period, such structures had commonly been built distinct; as the Campanile\\nand Torre del ’Orologio of St. Mark to this day attest.', 'But it was upon the great state-bell that the founder lavished his more daring\\nskill. In vain did some of the less elated magistrates here caution him; saying\\nthat though truly the tower was Titanic, yet limit should be set to the\\ndependent weight of its swaying masses. But undeterred, he prepared his mammoth\\nmould, dented with mythological devices; kindled his fires of balsamic firs;\\nmelted his tin and copper, and, throwing in much plate, contributed by the\\npublic spirit of the nobles, let loose the tide.', 'The unleashed metals bayed like hounds. The workmen shrunk. Through their\\nfright, fatal harm to the bell was dreaded. Fearless as Shadrach, Bannadonna,\\nrushing through the glow, smote the chief culprit with his ponderous ladle.\\nFrom the smitten part, a splinter was dashed into the seething mass, and at\\nonce was melted in.', 'Next day a portion of the work was heedfully uncovered. All seemed right. Upon\\nthe third morning, with equal satisfaction, it was bared still lower. At\\nlength, like some old Theban king, the whole cooled casting was disinterred.\\nAll was fair except in one strange spot. But as he suffered no one to attend\\nhim in these inspections, he concealed the blemish by some preparation which\\nnone knew better to devise.', 'The casting of such a mass was deemed no small triumph for the caster; one,\\ntoo, in which the state might not scorn to share. The homicide was overlooked.\\nBy the charitable that deed was but imputed to sudden transports of esthetic\\npassion, not to any flagitious quality. A kick from an Arabian charger; not\\nsign of vice, but blood.', 'His felony remitted by the judge, absolution given him by the priest, what more\\ncould even a sickly conscience have desired.', 'Honoring the tower and its builder with another holiday, the republic witnessed\\nthe hoisting of the bells and clock-work amid shows and pomps superior to the\\nformer.', 'Some months of more than usual solitude on Bannadonna’s part ensued. It\\nwas not unknown that he was engaged upon something for the belfry, intended to\\ncomplete it, and surpass all that had gone before. Most people imagined that\\nthe design would involve a casting like the bells. But those who thought they\\nhad some further insight, would shake their heads, with hints, that not for\\nnothing did the mechanician keep so secret. Meantime, his seclusion failed not\\nto invest his work with more or less of that sort of mystery pertaining to the\\nforbidden.', 'Ere long he had a heavy object hoisted to the belfry, wrapped in a dark sack or\\ncloak—a procedure sometimes had in the case of an elaborate piece of\\nsculpture, or statue, which, being intended to grace the front of a new\\nedifice, the architect does not desire exposed to critical eyes, till set up,\\nfinished, in its appointed place. Such was the impression now. But, as the\\nobject rose, a statuary present observed, or thought he did, that it was not\\nentirely rigid, but was, in a manner, pliant. At last, when the hidden thing\\nhad attained its final height, and, obscurely seen from below, seemed almost of\\nitself to step into the belfry, as if with little assistance from the crane, a\\nshrewd old blacksmith present ventured the suspicion that it was but a living\\nman. This surmise was thought a foolish one, while the general interest failed\\nnot to augment.', 'Not without demur from Bannadonna, the chief-magistrate of the town, with an\\nassociate—both elderly men—followed what seemed the image up the\\ntower. But, arrived at the belfry, they had little recompense. Plausibly\\nentrenching himself behind the conceded mysteries of his art, the mechanician\\nwithheld present explanation. The magistrates glanced toward the cloaked\\nobject, which, to their surprise, seemed now to have changed its attitude, or\\nelse had before been more perplexingly concealed by the violent muffling action\\nof the wind without. It seemed now seated upon some sort of frame, or chair,\\ncontained within the domino. They observed that nigh the top, in a sort of\\nsquare, the web of the cloth, either from accident or design, had its warp\\npartly withdrawn, and the cross threads plucked out here and there, so as to\\nform a sort of woven grating. Whether it were the low wind or no, stealing\\nthrough the stone lattice-work, or only their own perturbed imaginations, is\\nuncertain, but they thought they discerned a slight sort of fitful, spring-like\\nmotion, in the domino. Nothing, however incidental or insignificant, escaped\\ntheir uneasy eyes. Among other things, they pried out, in a corner, an earthen\\ncup, partly corroded and partly encrusted, and one whispered to the other, that\\nthis cup was just such a one as might, in mockery, be offered to the lips of\\nsome brazen statue, or, perhaps, still worse.', 'But, being questioned, the mechanician said, that the cup was simply used in\\nhis founder’s business, and described the purpose; in short, a cup to\\ntest the condition of metals in fusion. He added, that it had got into the\\nbelfry by the merest chance.', 'Again, and again, they gazed at the domino, as at some suspicious incognito at\\na Venetian mask. All sorts of vague apprehensions stirred them. They even\\ndreaded lest, when they should descend, the mechanician, though without a flesh\\nand blood companion, for all that, would not be left alone.', 'Affecting some merriment at their disquietude, he begged to relieve them, by\\nextending a coarse sheet of workman’s canvas between them and the object.', 'Meantime he sought to interest them in his other work; nor, now that the domino\\nwas out of sight, did they long remain insensible to the artistic wonders lying\\nround them; wonders hitherto beheld but in their unfinished state; because,\\nsince hoisting the bells, none but the caster had entered within the belfry. It\\nwas one trait of his, that, even in details, he would not let another do what\\nhe could, without too great loss of time, accomplish for himself. So, for\\nseveral preceding weeks, whatever hours were unemployed in his secret design,\\nhad been devoted to elaborating the figures on the bells.', 'The clock-bell, in particular, now drew attention. Under a patient chisel, the\\nlatent beauty of its enrichments, before obscured by the cloudings incident to\\ncasting, that beauty in its shyest grace, was now revealed. Round and round the\\nbell, twelve figures of gay girls, garlanded, hand-in-hand, danced in a choral\\nring—the embodied hours.', '“Bannadonna,” said the chief, “this bell excels all else. No\\nadded touch could here improve. Hark!” hearing a sound, “was that\\nthe wind?”', '“The wind, Excellenza,” was the light response. “But the\\nfigures, they are not yet without their faults. They need some touches yet.\\nWhen those are given, and the—block yonder,” pointing towards the\\ncanvas screen, “when Haman there, as I merrily call him,—him?\\nit, I mean—when Haman is fixed on this, his lofty tree, then,\\ngentlemen, will I be most happy to receive you here again.”', 'The equivocal reference to the object caused some return of restlessness.\\nHowever, on their part, the visitors forbore further allusion to it, unwilling,\\nperhaps, to let the foundling see how easily it lay within his plebeian art to\\nstir the placid dignity of nobles.', '“Well, Bannadonna,” said the chief, “how long ere you are\\nready to set the clock going, so that the hour shall be sounded? Our interest\\nin you, not less than in the work itself, makes us anxious to be assured of\\nyour success. The people, too,—why, they are shouting now. Say the exact\\nhour when you will be ready.”', '“To-morrow, Excellenza, if you listen for it,—or should you not,\\nall the same—strange music will be heard. The stroke of one shall be the\\nfirst from yonder bell,” pointing to the bell adorned with girls and\\ngarlands, “that stroke shall fall there, where the hand of Una clasps\\nDua’s. The stroke of one shall sever that loved clasp. To-morrow, then,\\nat one o’clock, as struck here, precisely here,” advancing and\\nplacing his finger upon the clasp, “the poor mechanic will be most happy\\nonce more to give you liege audience, in this his littered shop. Farewell till\\nthen, illustrious magnificoes, and hark ye for your vassal’s\\nstroke.”', 'His still, Vulcanic face hiding its burning brightness like a forge, he moved\\nwith ostentatious deference towards the scuttle, as if so far to escort their\\nexit. But the junior magistrate, a kind-hearted man, troubled at what seemed to\\nhim a certain sardonical disdain, lurking beneath the foundling’s humble\\nmien, and in Christian sympathy more distressed at it on his account than on\\nhis own, dimly surmising what might be the final fate of such a cynic\\nsolitaire, nor perhaps uninfluenced by the general strangeness of surrounding\\nthings, this good magistrate had glanced sadly, sideways from the speaker, and\\nthereupon his foreboding eye had started at the expression of the unchanging\\nface of the Hour Una.', '“How is this, Bannadonna?” he lowly asked, “Una looks unlike\\nher sisters.”', '“In Christ’s name, Bannadonna,” impulsively broke in the\\nchief, his attention, for the first attracted to the figure, by his\\nassociate’s remark, “Una’s face looks just like that of\\nDeborah, the prophetess, as painted by the Florentine, Del Fonca.”', '“Surely, Bannadonna,” lowly resumed the milder magistrate,\\n“you meant the twelve should wear the same jocundly abandoned air. But\\nsee, the smile of Una seems but a fatal one. ’Tis different.”', 'While his mild associate was speaking, the chief glanced, inquiringly, from him\\nto the caster, as if anxious to mark how the discrepancy would be accounted\\nfor. As the chief stood, his advanced foot was on the scuttle’s curb.', 'Bannadonna spoke:', '“Excellenza, now that, following your keener eye, I glance upon the face\\nof Una, I do, indeed perceive some little variance. But look all round the\\nbell, and you will find no two faces entirely correspond. Because there is a\\nlaw in art—but the cold wind is rising more; these lattices are but a\\npoor defense. Suffer me, magnificoes, to conduct you, at least, partly on your\\nway. Those in whose well-being there is a public stake, should be heedfully\\nattended.”', '“Touching the look of Una, you were saying, Bannadonna, that there was a\\ncertain law in art,” observed the chief, as the three now descended the\\nstone shaft, “pray, tell me, then—.”', '“Pardon; another time, Excellenza;—the tower is damp.”', '“Nay, I must rest, and hear it now. Here,—here is a wide landing,\\nand through this leeward slit, no wind, but ample light. Tell us of your law;\\nand at large.”', '“Since, Excellenza, you insist, know that there is a law in art, which\\nbars the possibility of duplicates. Some years ago, you may remember, I graved\\na small seal for your republic, bearing, for its chief device, the head of your\\nown ancestor, its illustrious founder. It becoming necessary, for the\\ncustoms’ use, to have innumerable impressions for bales and boxes, I\\ngraved an entire plate, containing one hundred of the seals. Now, though,\\nindeed, my object was to have those hundred heads identical, and though, I dare\\nsay, people think them; so, yet, upon closely scanning an uncut impression from\\nthe plate, no two of those five-score faces, side by side, will be found alike.\\nGravity is the air of all; but, diversified in all. In some, benevolent; in\\nsome, ambiguous; in two or three, to a close scrutiny, all but incipiently\\nmalign, the variation of less than a hair’s breadth in the linear\\nshadings round the mouth sufficing to all this. Now, Excellenza, transmute that\\ngeneral gravity into joyousness, and subject it to twelve of those variations I\\nhave described, and tell me, will you not have my hours here, and Una one of\\nthem? But I like—.”', '“Hark! is that—a footfall above?”', '“Mortar, Excellenza; sometimes it drops to the belfry-floor from the arch\\nwhere the stonework was left undressed. I must have it seen to. As I was about\\nto say: for one, I like this law forbidding duplicates. It evokes fine\\npersonalities. Yes, Excellenza, that strange, and—to you—uncertain\\nsmile, and those fore-looking eyes of Una, suit Bannadonna very well.”', '“Hark!—sure we left no soul above?”', '“No soul, Excellenza; rest assured, no soul—Again the\\nmortar.”', '“It fell not while we were there.”', '“Ah, in your presence, it better knew its place, Excellenza,”\\nblandly bowed Bannadonna.', '“But, Una,” said the milder magistrate, “she seemed intently\\ngazing on you; one would have almost sworn that she picked you out from among\\nus three.”', '“If she did, possibly, it might have been her finer apprehension,\\nExcellenza.”', '“How, Bannadonna? I do not understand you.”', '“No consequence, no consequence, Excellenza—but the shifted wind is\\nblowing through the slit. Suffer me to escort you on; and then, pardon, but the\\ntoiler must to his tools.”', '“It may be foolish, Signor,” said the milder magistrate, as, from\\nthe third landing, the two now went down unescorted, “but, somehow, our\\ngreat mechanician moves me strangely. Why, just now, when he so superciliously\\nreplied, his walk seemed Sisera’s, God’s vain foe, in Del\\nFonca’s painting. And that young, sculptured Deborah, too. Ay, and\\nthat—.”', '“Tush, tush, Signor!” returned the chief. “A passing whim.\\nDeborah?—Where’s Jael, pray?”', '“Ah,” said the other, as they now stepped upon the sod, “Ah,\\nSignor, I see you leave your fears behind you with the chill and gloom; but\\nmine, even in this sunny air, remain. Hark!”', 'It was a sound from just within the tower door, whence they had emerged.\\nTurning, they saw it closed.', '“He has slipped down and barred us out,” smiled the chief;\\n“but it is his custom.”', 'Proclamation was now made, that the next day, at one hour after meridian, the\\nclock would strike, and—thanks to the mechanician’s powerful\\nart—with unusual accompaniments. But what those should be, none as yet\\ncould say. The announcement was received with cheers.', 'By the looser sort, who encamped about the tower all night, lights were seen\\ngleaming through the topmost blind-work, only disappearing with the morning\\nsun. Strange sounds, too, were heard, or were thought to be, by those whom\\nanxious watching might not have left mentally undisturbed—sounds, not\\nonly of some ringing implement, but also—so they\\nsaid—half-suppressed screams and plainings, such as might have issued\\nfrom some ghostly engine, overplied.', 'Slowly the day drew on; part of the concourse chasing the weary time with songs\\nand games, till, at last, the great blurred sun rolled, like a football,\\nagainst the plain.', 'At noon, the nobility and principal citizens came from the town in cavalcade, a\\nguard of soldiers, also, with music, the more to honor the occasion.', 'Only one hour more. Impatience grew. Watches were held in hands of feverish\\nmen, who stood, now scrutinizing their small dial-plates, and then, with neck\\nthrown back, gazing toward the belfry, as if the eye might foretell that which\\ncould only be made sensible to the ear; for, as yet, there was no dial to the\\ntower-clock.', 'The hour hands of a thousand watches now verged within a hair’s breadth\\nof the figure 1. A silence, as of the expectation of some Shiloh, pervaded the\\nswarming plain. Suddenly a dull, mangled sound—naught ringing in it;\\nscarcely audible, indeed, to the outer circles of the people—that dull\\nsound dropped heavily from the belfry. At the same moment, each man stared at\\nhis neighbor blankly. All watches were upheld. All hour-hands were at—had\\npassed—the figure 1. No bell-stroke from the tower. The multitude became\\ntumultuous.', 'Waiting a few moments, the chief magistrate, commanding silence, hailed the\\nbelfry, to know what thing unforeseen had happened there.', 'No response.', 'He hailed again and yet again.', 'All continued hushed.', 'By his order, the soldiers burst in the tower-door; when, stationing guards to\\ndefend it from the now surging mob, the chief, accompanied by his former\\nassociate, climbed the winding stairs. Half-way up, they stopped to listen. No\\nsound. Mounting faster, they reached the belfry; but, at the threshold, started\\nat the spectacle disclosed. A spaniel, which, unbeknown to them, had followed\\nthem thus far, stood shivering as before some unknown monster in a brake: or,\\nrather, as if it snuffed footsteps leading to some other world.', 'Bannadonna lay, prostrate and bleeding, at the base of the bell which was\\nadorned with girls and garlands. He lay at the feet of the hour Una; his head\\ncoinciding, in a vertical line, with her left hand, clasped by the hour Dua.\\nWith downcast face impending over him, like Jael over nailed Sisera in the\\ntent, was the domino; now no more becloaked.', 'It had limbs, and seemed clad in a scaly mail, lustrous as a\\ndragon-beetle’s. It was manacled, and its clubbed arms were uplifted, as\\nif, with its manacles, once more to smite its already smitten victim. One\\nadvanced foot of it was inserted beneath the dead body, as if in the act of\\nspurning it.', 'Uncertainty falls on what now followed.', 'It were but natural to suppose that the magistrates would, at first, shrink\\nfrom immediate personal contact with what they saw. At the least, for a time,\\nthey would stand in involuntary doubt; it may be, in more or less of horrified\\nalarm. Certain it is, that an arquebuss was called for from below. And some\\nadd, that its report, followed by a fierce whiz, as of the sudden snapping of a\\nmain-spring, with a steely din, as if a stack of sword-blades should be dashed\\nupon a pavement, these blended sounds came ringing to the plain, attracting\\nevery eye far upward to the belfry, whence, through the lattice-work, thin\\nwreaths of smoke were curling.', 'Some averred that it was the spaniel, gone mad by fear, which was shot. This,\\nothers denied. True it was, the spaniel never more was seen; and, probably, for\\nsome unknown reason, it shared the burial now to be related of the domino. For,\\nwhatever the preceding circumstances may have been, the first instinctive panic\\nover, or else all ground of reasonable fear removed, the two magistrates, by\\nthemselves, quickly rehooded the figure in the dropped cloak wherein it had\\nbeen hoisted. The same night, it was secretly lowered to the ground, smuggled\\nto the beach, pulled far out to sea, and sunk. Nor to any after urgency, even\\nin free convivial hours, would the twain ever disclose the full secrets of the\\nbelfry.', 'From the mystery unavoidably investing it, the popular solution of the\\nfoundling’s fate involved more or less of supernatural agency. But some\\nfew less unscientific minds pretended to find little difficulty in otherwise\\naccounting for it. In the chain of circumstantial inferences drawn, there may,\\nor may not, have been some absent or defective links. But, as the explanation\\nin question is the only one which tradition has explicitly preserved, in dearth\\nof better, it will here be given. But, in the first place, it is requisite to\\npresent the supposition entertained as to the entire motive and mode, with\\ntheir origin, of the secret design of Bannadonna; the minds above-mentioned\\nassuming to penetrate as well into his soul as into the event. The disclosure\\nwill indirectly involve reference to peculiar matters, none of, the clearest,\\nbeyond the immediate subject.', 'At that period, no large bell was made to sound otherwise than as at present,\\nby agitation of a tongue within, by means of ropes, or percussion from without,\\neither from cumbrous machinery, or stalwart watchmen, armed with heavy hammers,\\nstationed in the belfry, or in sentry-boxes on the open roof, according as the\\nbell was sheltered or exposed.', 'It was from observing these exposed bells, with their watchmen, that the\\nfoundling, as was opined, derived the first suggestion of his scheme. Perched\\non a great mast or spire, the human figure, viewed from below, undergoes such a\\nreduction in its apparent size, as to obliterate its intelligent features. It\\nevinces no personality. Instead of bespeaking volition, its gestures rather\\nresemble the automatic ones of the arms of a telegraph.', 'Musing, therefore, upon the purely Punchinello aspect of the human figure thus\\nbeheld, it had indirectly occurred to Bannadonna to devise some metallic agent,\\nwhich should strike the hour with its mechanic hand, with even greater\\nprecision than the vital one. And, moreover, as the vital watchman on the roof,\\nsallying from his retreat at the given periods, walked to the bell with\\nuplifted mace, to smite it, Bannadonna had resolved that his invention should\\nlikewise possess the power of locomotion, and, along with that, the appearance,\\nat least, of intelligence and will.', 'If the conjectures of those who claimed acquaintance with the intent of\\nBannadonna be thus far correct, no unenterprising spirit could have been his.\\nBut they stopped not here; intimating that though, indeed, his design had, in\\nthe first place, been prompted by the sight of the watchman, and confined to\\nthe devising of a subtle substitute for him: yet, as is not seldom the case\\nwith projectors, by insensible gradations, proceeding from comparatively pigmy\\naims to Titanic ones, the original scheme had, in its anticipated\\neventualities, at last, attained to an unheard of degree of daring.', 'He still bent his efforts upon the locomotive figure for the belfry, but only\\nas a partial type of an ulterior creature, a sort of elephantine Helot, adapted\\nto further, in a degree scarcely to be imagined, the universal conveniences and\\nglories of humanity; supplying nothing less than a supplement to the Six\\nDays’ Work; stocking the earth with a new serf, more useful than the ox,\\nswifter than the dolphin, stronger than the lion, more cunning than the ape,\\nfor industry an ant, more fiery than serpents, and yet, in patience, another\\nass. All excellences of all God-made creatures, which served man, were here to\\nreceive advancement, and then to be combined in one. Talus was to have been the\\nall-accomplished Helot’s name. Talus, iron slave to Bannadonna, and,\\nthrough him, to man.', 'Here, it might well be thought that, were these last conjectures as to the\\nfoundling’s secrets not erroneous, then must he have been hopelessly\\ninfected with the craziest chimeras of his age; far outgoing Albert Magus and\\nCornelius Agrippa. But the contrary was averred. However marvelous his design,\\nhowever apparently transcending not alone the bounds of human invention, but\\nthose of divine creation, yet the proposed means to be employed were alleged to\\nhave been confined within the sober forms of sober reason. It was affirmed\\nthat, to a degree of more than skeptic scorn, Bannadonna had been without\\nsympathy for any of the vain-glorious irrationalities of his time. For example,\\nhe had not concluded, with the visionaries among the metaphysicians, that\\nbetween the finer mechanic forces and the ruder animal vitality some germ of\\ncorrespondence might prove discoverable. As little did his scheme partake of\\nthe enthusiasm of some natural philosophers, who hoped, by physiological and\\nchemical inductions, to arrive at a knowledge of the source of life, and so\\nqualify themselves to manufacture and improve upon it. Much less had he aught\\nin common with the tribe of alchemists, who sought, by a species of\\nincantations, to evoke some surprising vitality from the laboratory. Neither\\nhad he imagined, with certain sanguine theosophists, that, by faithful\\nadoration of the Highest, unheard-of powers would be vouchsafed to man. A\\npractical materialist, what Bannadonna had aimed at was to have been reached,\\nnot by logic, not by crucible, not by conjuration, not by altars; but by plain\\nvice-bench and hammer. In short, to solve nature, to steal into her, to\\nintrigue beyond her, to procure some one else to bind her to his\\nhand;—these, one and all, had not been his objects; but, asking no favors\\nfrom any element or any being, of himself, to rival her, outstrip her, and rule\\nher. He stooped to conquer. With him, common sense was theurgy; machinery,\\nmiracle; Prometheus, the heroic name for machinist; man, the true God.', 'Nevertheless, in his initial step, so far as the experimental automaton for the\\nbelfry was concerned, he allowed fancy some little play; or, perhaps, what\\nseemed his fancifulness was but his utilitarian ambition collaterally extended.\\nIn figure, the creature for the belfry should not be likened after the human\\npattern, nor any animal one, nor after the ideals, however wild, of ancient\\nfable, but equally in aspect as in organism be an original production; the more\\nterrible to behold, the better.', 'Such, then, were the suppositions as to the present scheme, and the reserved\\nintent. How, at the very threshold, so unlooked for a catastrophe overturned\\nall, or rather, what was the conjecture here, is now to be set forth.', 'It was thought that on the day preceding the fatality, his visitors having left\\nhim, Bannadonna had unpacked the belfry image, adjusted it, and placed it in\\nthe retreat provided—a sort of sentry-box in one corner of the belfry; in\\nshort, throughout the night, and for some part of the ensuing morning, he had\\nbeen engaged in arranging everything connected with the domino; the issuing\\nfrom the sentry-box each sixty minutes; sliding along a grooved way, like a\\nrailway; advancing to the clock-bell, with uplifted manacles; striking it at\\none of the twelve junctions of the four-and-twenty hands; then wheeling,\\ncircling the bell, and retiring to its post, there to bide for another sixty\\nminutes, when the same process was to be repeated; the bell, by a cunning\\nmechanism, meantime turning on its vertical axis, so as to present, to the\\ndescending mace, the clasped hands of the next two figures, when it would\\nstrike two, three, and so on, to the end. The musical metal in this time-bell\\nbeing so managed in the fusion, by some art, perishing with its originator,\\nthat each of the clasps of the four-and-twenty hands should give forth its own\\npeculiar resonance when parted.', 'But on the magic metal, the magic and metallic stranger never struck but that\\none stroke, drove but that one nail, served but that one clasp, by which\\nBannadonna clung to his ambitious life. For, after winding up the creature in\\nthe sentry-box, so that, for the present, skipping the intervening hours, it\\nshould not emerge till the hour of one, but should then infallibly emerge, and,\\nafter deftly oiling the grooves whereon it was to slide, it was surmised that\\nthe mechanician must then have hurried to the bell, to give his final touches\\nto its sculpture. True artist, he here became absorbed; and absorption still\\nfurther intensified, it may be, by his striving to abate that strange look of\\nUna; which, though, before others, he had treated with such unconcern, might\\nnot, in secret, have been without its thorn.', 'And so, for the interval, he was oblivious of his creature; which, not\\noblivious of him, and true to its creation, and true to its heedful winding up,\\nleft its post precisely at the given moment; along its well-oiled route, slid\\nnoiselessly towards its mark; and, aiming at the hand of Una, to ring one\\nclangorous note, dully smote the intervening brain of Bannadonna, turned\\nbackwards to it; the manacled arms then instantly up-springing to their\\nhovering poise. The falling body clogged the thing’s return; so there it\\nstood, still impending over Bannadonna, as if whispering some post-mortem\\nterror. The chisel lay dropped from the hand, but beside the hand; the\\noil-flask spilled across the iron track.', 'In his unhappy end, not unmindful of the rare genius of the mechanician, the\\nrepublic decreed him a stately funeral. It was resolved that the great\\nbell—the one whose casting had been jeopardized through the timidity of\\nthe ill-starred workman—should be rung upon the entrance of the bier into\\nthe cathedral. The most robust man of the country round was assigned the office\\nof bell-ringer.', 'But as the pall-bearers entered the cathedral porch, naught but a broken and\\ndisastrous sound, like that of some lone Alpine land-slide, fell from the tower\\nupon their ears. And then, all was hushed.', 'Glancing backwards, they saw the groined belfry crashed sideways in. It\\nafterwards appeared that the powerful peasant, who had the bell-rope in charge,\\nwishing to test at once the full glory of the bell, had swayed down upon the\\nrope with one concentrate jerk. The mass of quaking metal, too ponderous for\\nits frame, and strangely feeble somewhere at its top, loosed from its\\nfastening, tore sideways down, and tumbling in one sheer fall, three hundred\\nfeet to the soft sward below, buried itself inverted and half out of sight.', 'Upon its disinterment, the main fracture was found to have started from a small\\nspot in the ear; which, being scraped, revealed a defect, deceptively minute in\\nthe casting; which defect must subsequently have been pasted over with some\\nunknown compound.', 'The remolten metal soon reassumed its place in the tower’s repaired\\nsuperstructure. For one year the metallic choir of birds sang musically in its\\nbelfry-bough-work of sculptured blinds and traceries. But on the first\\nanniversary of the tower’s completion—at early dawn, before the\\nconcourse had surrounded it—an earthquake came; one loud crash was heard.\\nThe stone-pine, with all its bower of songsters, lay overthrown upon the plain.', 'So the blind slave obeyed its blinder lord; but, in obedience, slew him. So the\\ncreator was killed by the creature. So the bell was too heavy for the tower. So\\nthe bell’s main weakness was where man’s blood had flawed it. And\\nso pride went before the fall.'], ['Between two tall gate-posts of rough-hewn stone (the gate itself having fallen\\nfrom its hinges at some unknown epoch) we beheld the gray front of the old\\nparsonage, terminating the vista of an avenue of black-ash trees. It was now a\\ntwelvemonth since the funeral procession of the venerable clergyman, its last\\ninhabitant, had turned from that gateway towards the village burying-ground.\\nThe wheel-track leading to the door, as well as the whole breadth of the\\navenue, was almost overgrown with grass, affording dainty mouthfuls to two or\\nthree vagrant cows and an old white horse who had his own living to pick up\\nalong the roadside. The glimmering shadows that lay half asleep between the\\ndoor of the house and the public highway were a kind of spiritual medium, seen\\nthrough which the edifice had not quite the aspect of belonging to the material\\nworld. Certainly it had little in common with those ordinary abodes which stand\\nso imminent upon the road that every passer-by can thrust his head, as it were,\\ninto the domestic circle. From these quiet windows the figures of passing\\ntravellers looked too remote and dim to disturb the sense of privacy. In its\\nnear retirement and accessible seclusion, it was the very spot for the\\nresidence of a clergyman,—a man not estranged from human life, yet\\nenveloped, in the midst of it, with a veil woven of intermingled gloom and\\nbrightness. It was worthy to have been one of the time-honored parsonages of\\nEngland, in which, through many generations, a succession of holy occupants\\npass from youth to age, and bequeath each an inheritance of sanctity to pervade\\nthe house and hover over it as with an atmosphere.', 'Nor, in truth, had the Old Manse ever been profaned by a lay occupant until\\nthat memorable summer afternoon when I entered it as my home. A priest had\\nbuilt it; a priest had succeeded to it; other priestly men from time to time\\nhad dwelt in it; and children born in its chambers had grown up to assume the\\npriestly character. It was awful to reflect how many sermons must have been\\nwritten there. The latest inhabitant alone—he by whose translation to\\nparadise the dwelling was left vacant—had penned nearly three thousand\\ndiscourses, besides the better, if not the greater, number that gushed living\\nfrom his lips. How often, no doubt, had he paced to and fro along the avenue,\\nattuning his meditations to the sighs and gentle murmurs and deep and solemn\\npeals of the wind among the lofty tops of the trees! In that variety of natural\\nutterances he could find something accordant with every passage of his sermon,\\nwere it of tenderness or reverential fear. The boughs over my head seemed\\nshadowy with solemn thoughts, as well as with rustling leaves. I took shame to\\nmyself for having been so long a writer of idle stories, and ventured to hope\\nthat wisdom would descend upon me with the falling leaves of the avenue, and\\nthat I should light upon an intellectual treasure in the Old Manse well worth\\nthose hoards of long-hidden gold which people seek for in moss-grown houses.\\nProfound treatises of morality; a layman’s unprofessional, and therefore\\nunprejudiced, views of religion; histories (such as Bancroft might have written\\nhad he taken up his abode here, as he once purposed) bright with picture,\\ngleaming over a depth of philosophic thought,—these were the works that\\nmight fitly have flowed from such a retirement. In the humblest event, I\\nresolved at least to achieve a novel that should evolve some deep lesson, and\\nshould possess physical substance enough to stand alone.', 'In furtherance of my design, and as if to leave me no pretext for not\\nfulfilling it, there was in the rear of the house the most delightful little\\nnook of a study that ever afforded its snug seclusion to a scholar. It was here\\nthat Emerson wrote Nature; for he was then an inhabitant of the Manse, and used\\nto watch the Assyrian dawn and Paphian sunset and moonrise from the summit of\\nour eastern hill. When I first saw the room, its walls were blackened with the\\nsmoke of unnumbered years, and made still blacker by the grim prints of Puritan\\nministers that hung around. These worthies looked strangely like bad angels, or\\nat least like men who had wrestled so continually and so sternly with the Devil\\nthat somewhat of his sooty fierceness had been imparted to their own visages.\\nThey had all vanished now; a cheerful coat of paint and golden-tinted\\npaper-hangings lighted up the small apartment; while the shadow of a\\nwillow-tree that swept against the overhanging eaves atempered the cheery\\nwestern sunshine. In place of the grim prints there was the sweet and lovely\\nhead of one of Raphael’s Madonnas, and two pleasant little pictures of the Lake\\nof Como. The only other decorations were a purple vase of flowers, always\\nfresh, and a bronze one containing graceful ferns. My books (few, and by no\\nmeans choice; for they were chiefly such waifs as chance had thrown in my way)\\nstood in order about the room, seldom to be disturbed.', 'The study had three windows, set with little, old-fashioned panes of glass,\\neach with a crack across it. The two on the western side looked, or rather\\npeeped, between the willow branches, down into the orchard, with glimpses of\\nthe river through the trees. The third, facing northward, commanded a broader\\nview of the river, at a spot where its hitherto obscure waters gleam forth into\\nthe light of history. It was at this window that the clergyman who then dwelt\\nin the Manse stood watching the outbreak of a long and deadly struggle between\\ntwo nations; he saw the irregular array of his parishioners on the farther side\\nof the river, and the glittering line of the British on the hither bank. He\\nawaited, in an agony of suspense, the rattle of the musketry. It came; and\\nthere needed but a gentle wind to sweep the battle-smoke around this quiet\\nhouse.', 'Perhaps the reader, whom I cannot help considering as my guest in the Old\\nManse, and entitled to all courtesy in the way of sight-showing,—perhaps\\nhe will choose to take a nearer view of the memorable spot. We stand now on the\\nriver’s brink. It may well be called the Concord,—the river of peace and\\nquietness; for it is certainly the most unexcitable and sluggish stream that\\never loitered imperceptibly towards its eternity,—the sea. Positively I\\nhad lived three weeks beside it before it grew quite clear to my perception\\nwhich way the current flowed. It never has a vivacious aspect, except when a\\nnorthwestern breeze is vexing its surface on a sunshiny day. From the incurable\\nindolence of its nature, the stream is happily incapable of becoming the slave\\nof human ingenuity, as is the fate of so many a wild, free mountain torrent.\\nWhile all things else are compelled to subserve some useful purpose, it idles\\nits sluggish life away in lazy liberty, without turning a solitary spindle or\\naffording even water-power enough to grind the corn that grows upon its banks.\\nThe torpor of its movement allows it nowhere a bright, pebbly shore, nor so\\nmuch as a narrow strip of glistening sand, in any part of its course. It\\nslumbers between broad prairies, kissing the long meadow grass, and bathes the\\noverhanging boughs of elder-bushes and willows, or the roots of elms and\\nash-trees and clumps of maples. Flags and rushes grow along its plashy shore;\\nthe yellow water-lily spreads its broad, flat leaves on the margin; and the\\nfragrant white pond-lily abounds, generally selecting a position just so far\\nfrom the river’s brink that it cannot be grasped save at the hazard of plunging\\nin.', 'It is a marvel whence this perfect flower derives its loveliness and perfume,\\nspringing as it does from the black mud over which the river sleeps, and where\\nlurk the slimy eel, and speckled frog, and the mud-turtle, whom continual\\nwashing cannot cleanse. It is the very same black mud out of which the yellow\\nlily sucks its obscene life and noisome odor. Thus we see, too, in the world\\nthat some persons assimilate only what is ugly and evil from the same moral\\ncircumstances which supply good and beautiful results—the fragrance of\\ncelestial flowers—to the daily life of others.', 'The reader must not, from any testimony of mine, contract a dislike towards our\\nslumberous stream. In the light of a calm and golden sunset it becomes lovely\\nbeyond expression; the more lovely for the quietude that so well accords with\\nthe hour, when even the wind, after blustering all day long, usually hushes\\nitself to rest. Each tree and rock and every blade of grass is distinctly\\nimaged, and, however unsightly in reality, assumes ideal beauty in the\\nreflection. The minutest things of earth and the broad aspect of the firmament\\nare pictured equally without effort and with the same felicity of success. All\\nthe sky glows downward at our feet; the rich clouds float through the unruffled\\nbosom of the stream like heavenly thoughts through a peaceful heart. We will\\nnot, then, malign our river as gross and impure while it can glorify itself\\nwith so adequate a picture of the heaven that broods above it; or, if we\\nremember its tawny hue and the muddiness of its bed, let it be a symbol that\\nthe earthiest human soul has an infinite spiritual capacity and may contain the\\nbetter world within its depths. But, indeed, the same lesson might be drawn out\\nof any mud-puddle in the streets of a city; and, being taught us everywhere, it\\nmust be true.', 'Come, we have pursued a somewhat devious track in our walk to the\\nbattle-ground. Here we are, at the point where the river was crossed by the old\\nbridge, the possession of which was the immediate object of the contest. On the\\nhither side grow two or three elms, throwing a wide circumference of shade, but\\nwhich must have been planted at some period within the threescore years and ten\\nthat have passed since the battle-day. On the farther shore, overhung by a\\nclump of elder-bushes, we discern the stone abutment of the bridge. Looking\\ndown into the river, I once discovered some heavy fragments of the timbers, all\\ngreen with half a century’s growth of water-moss; for during that length of\\ntime the tramp of horses and human footsteps have ceased along this ancient\\nhighway. The stream has here about the breadth of twenty strokes of a swimmer’s\\narm,—a space not too wide when the bullets were whistling across. Old\\npeople who dwell hereabouts will point out, the very spots on the western bank\\nwhere our countrymen fell down and died; and on this side of the river an\\nobelisk of granite has grown up from the soil that was fertilized with British\\nblood. The monument, not more than twenty feet in height, is such as it\\nbefitted the inhabitants of a village to erect in illustration of a matter of\\nlocal interest rather than what was suitable to commemorate an epoch of\\nnational history. Still, by the fathers of the village this famous deed was\\ndone; and their descendants might rightfully claim the privilege of building a\\nmemorial.', 'A humbler token of the fight, yet a more interesting one than the granite\\nobelisk, may be seen close under the stone wall which separates the\\nbattle-ground from the precincts of the parsonage. It is the\\ngrave,—marked by a small, mossgrown fragment of stone at the head and\\nanother at the foot,—the grave of two British soldiers who were slain in\\nthe skirmish, and have ever since slept peacefully where Zechariah Brown and\\nThomas Davis buried them. Soon was their warfare ended; a weary night-march\\nfrom Boston, a rattling volley of musketry across the river, and then these\\nmany years of rest. In the long procession of slain invaders who passed into\\neternity from the battle-fields of the Revolution, these two nameless soldiers\\nled the way.', 'Lowell, the poet, as we were once standing over this grave, told me a tradition\\nin reference to one of the inhabitants below. The story has something deeply\\nimpressive, though its circumstances cannot altogether be reconciled with\\nprobability. A youth in the service of the clergyman happened to be chopping\\nwood, that April morning, at the back door of the Manse; and when the noise of\\nbattle rang from side to side of the bridge, he hastened across the intervening\\nfield to see what might be going forward. It is rather strange, by the way,\\nthat this lad should have been so diligently at work when the whole population\\nof town and country were startled out of their customary business by the\\nadvance of the British troops. Be that as it might, the tradition, says that\\nthe lad now left his task and hurried to the battle-field with the axe still in\\nhis hand. The British had by this time retreated; the Americans were in\\npursuit; and the late scene of strife was thus deserted by both parties. Two\\nsoldiers lay on the ground,—one was a corpse; but, as the young\\nNew-Englander drew nigh, the other Briton raised himself painfully upon his\\nhands and knees and gave a ghastly stare into his face. The boy,—it must\\nhave been a nervous impulse, without purpose, without thought, and betokening a\\nsensitive and impressible nature rather than a hardened one,—the boy\\nuplifted his axe and dealt the wounded soldier a fierce and fatal blow upon the\\nhead.', 'I could wish that the grave might be opened; for I would fain know whether\\neither of the skeleton soldiers has the mark of an axe in his skull. The story\\ncomes home to me like truth. Oftentimes, as an intellectual and moral exercise,\\nI have sought to follow that poor youth through his subsequent career and\\nobserve how his soul was tortured by the blood-stain, contracted as it had been\\nbefore the long custom of war had robbed human life of its sanctity and while\\nit still seemed murderous to slay a brother man. This one circumstance has\\nborne more fruit for me than all that history tells us of the fight.', 'Many strangers come in the summer-time to view the battle-ground. For my own\\npart, I have never found my imagination much excited by this or any other scene\\nof historic celebrity; nor would the placid margin of the river have lost any\\nof its charm for me, had men never fought and died there. There is a wilder\\ninterest in the tract of land-perhaps a hundred yards in breadth—which\\nextends between the battle-field and the northern face of our Old Manse, with\\nits contiguous avenue and orchard. Here, in some unknown age, before the white\\nman came, stood an Indian village, convenient to the river, whence its\\ninhabitants must have drawn so large a part of their substance. The site is\\nidentified by the spear and arrow-heads, the chisels, and other implements of\\nwar, labor, and the chase, which the plough turns up from the soil. You see a\\nsplinter of stone, half hidden beneath a sod; it looks like nothing worthy of\\nnote; but, if you have faith enough to pick it up, behold a relic! Thoreau, who\\nhas a strange faculty of finding what the Indians have left behind them, first\\nset me on the search; and I afterwards enriched myself with some very perfect\\nspecimens, so rudely wrought that it seemed almost as if chance had fashioned\\nthem. Their great charm consists in this rudeness and in the individuality of\\neach article, so different from the productions of civilized machinery, which\\nshapes everything on one pattern. There is exquisite delight, too, in picking\\nup for one’s self an arrow-head that was dropped centuries ago and has never\\nbeen handled since, and which we thus receive directly from the hand of the red\\nhunter, who purposed to shoot it at his game or at an enemy. Such an incident\\nbuilds up again the Indian village and its encircling forest, and recalls to\\nlife the painted chiefs and warriors, the squaws at their household toil, and\\nthe children sporting among the wigwams, while the little wind-rocked pappose\\nswings from the branch of a tree. It can hardly be told whether it is a joy or\\na pain, after such a momentary vision, to gaze around in the broad daylight of\\nreality and see stone fences, white houses, potato-fields, and men doggedly\\nhoeing in their shirt-sleeves and homespun pantaloons. But this is nonsense.\\nThe Old Manse is better than a thousand wigwams.', 'The Old Manse! We had almost forgotten it, but will return thither through the\\norchard. This was set out by the last clergyman, in the decline of his life,\\nwhen the neighbors laughed at the hoary-headed man for planting trees from\\nwhich he could have no prospect of gathering fruit. Even had that been the\\ncase, there was only so much the better motive for planting them, in the pure\\nand unselfish hope of benefiting his successors,—an end so seldom\\nachieved by more ambitious efforts. But the old minister, before reaching his\\npatriarchal age of ninety, ate the apples from this orchard during many years,\\nand added silver and gold to his annual stipend by disposing of the\\nsuperfluity. It is pleasant to think of him walking among the trees in the\\nquiet afternoons of early autumn and picking up here and there a windfall,\\nwhile he observes how heavily the branches are weighed down, and computes the\\nnumber of empty flour-barrels that will be filled by their burden. He loved\\neach tree, doubtless, as if it had been his own child. An orchard has a\\nrelation to mankind, and readily connects itself with matters of the heart. The\\ntrees possess a domestic character; they have lost the wild nature of their\\nforest kindred, and have grown humanized by receiving the care of man as well\\nas by contributing to his wants. There, is so much individuality of character,\\ntoo, among apple trees, that it gives them all additional claim to be the\\nobjects of human interest. One is harsh and crabbed in its manifestations;\\nanother gives us fruit as mild as charity. One is churlish and illiberal,\\nevidently grudging the few apples that it bears; another exhausts itself in\\nfree-hearted benevolence. The variety of grotesque shapes into which apple,\\ntrees contort themselves has its effect on those who get acquainted with them:\\nthey stretch out their crooked branches, and take such hold of the imagination,\\nthat we remember them as humorists and odd fellows. And what is more melancholy\\nthan the old apple-trees that linger about the spot where once stood a\\nhomestead, but where there is now only a ruined chimney rising out of a grassy\\nand weed-grown cellar? They offer their fruit to every wayfarer,—apples\\nthat are bitter sweet with the moral of Time’s vicissitude.', 'I have met with no other such pleasant trouble in the world as that of finding\\nmyself, with only the two or three mouths which it was my privilege to feed,\\nthe sole inheritor of the old clergyman’s wealth of fruits. Throughout the\\nsummer there were cherries and currants; and then came Autumn, with his immense\\nburden of apples, dropping them continually from his over-laden shoulders as he\\ntrudged along. In the stillest afternoon, if I listened, the thump of a great\\napple was audible, falling without a breath of wind, from the mere necessity of\\nperfect ripeness. And, besides, there were pear-trees, that flung down bushels\\nupon bushels of heavy pears; and peach-trees, which, in a good year, tormented\\nme with peaches, neither to be eaten nor kept, nor, without labor and\\nperplexity, to be given away. The idea of an infinite generosity and\\nexhaustless bounty on the part of our Mother Nature was well worth obtaining\\nthrough such cares as these. That feeling can be enjoyed in perfection only by\\nthe natives of summer islands, where the bread-fruit, the cocoa, the palm, and\\nthe orange grow spontaneously and hold forth the ever-ready meal; but likewise\\nalmost as well by a man long habituated to city life, who plunges into such a\\nsolitude as that of the Old Manse, where he plucks the fruit of trees that he\\ndid not plant, and which therefore, to my heterodox taste, bear the closest\\nresemblance to those that grew in Eden. It has been an apothegm these five\\nthousand years, that toil sweetens the bread it earns. For my part (speaking\\nfrom hard experience, acquired while belaboring the rugged furrows of Brook\\nFarm), I relish best the free gifts of Providence.', 'Not that it can be disputed that the light toil requisite to cultivate a\\nmoderately sized garden imparts such zest to kitchen vegetables as is never\\nfound in those of the market-gardener. Childless men, if they would know\\nsomething of the bliss of paternity, should plant a seed,—be it squash,\\nbean, Indian corn, or perhaps a mere flower or worthless weed,—should\\nplant it with their own hands, and nurse it from infancy to maturity altogether\\nby their own care. If there be not too many of them, each individual plant\\nbecomes an object of separate interest. My garden, that skirted the avenue of\\nthe Manse, was of precisely the right extent. An hour or two of morning labor\\nwas all that it required. But I used to visit and revisit it a dozen times a\\nday, and stand in deep contemplation over my vegetable progeny with a love that\\nnobody could share or conceive of who had never taken part in the process of\\ncreation. It was one of the most bewitching sights in the world to observe a\\nhill of beans thrusting aside the soil, or a row of early peas just peeping\\nforth sufficiently to trace a line of delicate green. Later in the season the\\nhumming-birds were attracted by the blossoms of a peculiar variety of bean; and\\nthey were a joy to me, those little spiritual visitants, for deigning to sip\\nairy food out of my nectar-cups. Multitudes of bees used to bury themselves in\\nthe yellow blossoms of the summer-squashes. This, too, was a deep satisfaction;\\nalthough, when they had laden themselves with sweets, they flew away to some\\nunknown hive, which would give back nothing in requital of what my garden had\\ncontributed. But I was glad thus to fling a benefaction upon the passing breeze\\nwith the certainty that somebody must profit by it and that there would be a\\nlittle more honey in the world to allay the sourness and bitterness which\\nmankind is always complaining of. Yes, indeed; my life was the sweeter for that\\nhoney.', 'Speaking of summer-squashes, I must say a word of their beautiful and varied\\nforms. They presented an endless diversity of urns and vases, shallow or deep,\\nscalloped or plain, moulded in patterns which a sculptor would do well to copy,\\nsince Art has never invented anything more graceful. A hundred squashes in the\\ngarden were worth, in my eyes at least, of being rendered indestructible in\\nmarble. If ever Providence (but I know it never will) should assign me a\\nsuperfluity of gold, part of it shall be expended for a service of plate, or\\nmost delicate porcelain, to be wrought into the shapes of summer-squashes\\ngathered from vines which I will plant with my own hands. As dishes for\\ncontaining vegetables, they would be peculiarly appropriate.', 'But not merely the squeamish love of the beautiful was gratified by my toil in\\nthe kitchen-garden. There was a hearty enjoyment, likewise, in observing the\\ngrowth of the crook-necked winter-squashes from the first little bulb, with the\\nwithered blossom adhering to it, until they lay strewn upon the soil, big,\\nround fellows, hiding their heads beneath the leaves, but turning up their\\ngreat yellow rotundities to the noontide sun. Gazing at them, I felt that by my\\nagency something worth living for had been done. A new substance was born into\\nthe world. They were real and tangible existences, which the mind could seize\\nhold of and rejoice in. A cabbage, too,—especially the early Dutch\\ncabbage, which swells to a monstrous circumference, until its ambitious heart\\noften bursts asunder,—is a matter to be proud of when we can claim a\\nshare with the earth and sky in producing it. But, after all, the hugest\\npleasure is reserved until these vegetable children of ours are smoking on the\\ntable, and we, like Saturn, make a meal of them.', 'What with the river, the battle-field, the orchard, and the garden, the reader\\nbegins to despair of finding his way back into the Old Manse. But, in agreeable\\nweather, it is the truest hospitality to keep him out of doors. I never grew\\nquite acquainted with my habitation till a long spell of sulky rain had\\nconfined me beneath its roof. There could not be a more sombre aspect of\\nexternal nature than as then seen from the windows of my study. The great\\nwillow-tree had caught and retained among its leaves a whole cataract of water,\\nto be shaken down at intervals by the frequent gusts of wind. All day long, and\\nfor a week together, the rain was drip-drip-dripping and\\nsplash-splash-splashing from the eaves and bubbling and foaming into the tubs\\nbeneath the spouts. The old, unpainted shingles of the house and outbuildings\\nwere black with moisture; and the mosses of ancient growth upon the walls\\nlooked green and fresh, as if they were the newest things and afterthought of\\nTime. The usually mirrored surface of the river was blurred by an infinity of\\nraindrops; the whole landscape had a completely water-soaked appearance,\\nconveying the impression that the earth was wet through like a sponge; while\\nthe summit of a wooded hill, about a mile distant, was enveloped in a dense\\nmist, where the demon of the tempest seemed to have his abiding-place and to be\\nplotting still direr inclemencies.', 'Nature has no kindness, no hospitality, during a rain. In the fiercest beat of\\nsunny days she retains a secret mercy, and welcomes the wayfarer to shady nooks\\nof the woods whither the sun cannot penetrate; but she provides no shelter\\nagainst her storms. It makes us shiver to think of those deep, umbrageous\\nrecesses, those overshadowing banks, where we found such enjoyment during the\\nsultry afternoons. Not a twig of foliage there but would dash a little shower\\ninto our faces. Looking reproachfully towards the impenetrable sky,—if\\nsky there be above that dismal uniformity of cloud,—we are apt to murmur\\nagainst the whole system of the universe, since it involves the extinction of\\nso many summer days in so short a life by the hissing and spluttering rain. In\\nsuch spells of weather,—and it is to be supposed such weather\\ncame,—Eve’s bower in paradise must have been but a cheerless and aguish\\nkind of shelter, nowise comparable to the old parsonage, which had resources of\\nits own to beguile the week’s imprisonment. The idea of sleeping on a couch of\\nwet roses!', 'Happy the man who in a rainy day can betake himself to a huge garret, stored,\\nlike that of the Manse, with lumber that each generation has left behind it\\nfrom a period before the Revolution. Our garret was an arched hall, dimly\\nilluminated through small and dusty windows; it was but a twilight at the best;\\nand there were nooks, or rather caverns, of deep obscurity, the secrets of\\nwhich I never learned, being too reverent of their dust and cobwebs. The beams\\nand rafters, roughly hewn and with strips of bark still on them, and the rude\\nmasonry of the chimneys, made the garret look wild and uncivilized, an aspect\\nunlike what was seen elsewhere in the quiet and decorous old house. But on one\\nside there was a little whitewashed apartment, which bore the traditionary\\ntitle of the Saint’s Chamber, because holy men in their youth had slept, and\\nstudied, and prayed there. With its elevated retirement, its one window, its\\nsmall fireplace, and its closet convenient for an oratory, it was the very spot\\nwhere a young man might inspire himself with solemn enthusiasm and cherish\\nsaintly dreams. The occupants, at various epochs, had left brief records and\\nejaculations inscribed upon the walls. There, too, hung a tattered and\\nshrivelled roll of canvas, which on inspection proved to be the forcibly\\nwrought picture of a clergyman, in wig, band, and gown, holding a Bible in his\\nhand. As I turned his face towards the light, he eyed me with an air of\\nauthority such as men of his profession seldom assume in our days. The original\\nhad been pastor of the parish more than a century ago, a friend of Whitefield,\\nand almost his equal in fervid eloquence. I bowed before the effigy of the\\ndignified divine, and felt as if I had now met face to face with the ghost by\\nwhom, as there was reason to apprehend, the Manse was haunted.', 'Houses of any antiquity in New England are so invariably possessed with spirits\\nthat the matter seems hardly worth alluding to. Our ghost used to heave deep\\nsighs in a particular corner of the parlor, and sometimes rustled paper, as if\\nhe were turning over a sermon in the long upper entry,—where nevertheless\\nhe was invisible, in spite of the bright moonshine that fell through the\\neastern window. Not improbably he wished me to edit and publish a selection\\nfrom a chest full of manuscript discourses that stood in the garret. Once,\\nwhile Hillard and other friends sat talking with us in the twilight, there came\\na rustling noise as of a minister’s silk gown, sweeping through the very midst\\nof the company, so closely as almost to brush against the chairs. Still there\\nwas nothing visible. A yet stranger business was that of a ghostly\\nservant-maid, who used to be heard in the kitchen at deepest midnight, grinding\\ncoffee, cooking, ironing,—performing, in short, all kinds of domestic\\nlabor,—although no traces of anything accomplished could be detected the\\nnext morning. Some neglected duty of her servitude, some ill-starched\\nministerial band, disturbed the poor damsel in her grave and kept her at work\\nwithout any wages.', 'But to return from this digression. A part of my predecessor’s library was\\nstored in the garret,—no unfit receptacle indeed for such dreary trash as\\ncomprised the greater number of volumes. The old books would have been worth\\nnothing at an auction. In this venerable garret, however, they possessed an\\ninterest, quite apart from their literary value, as heirlooms, many of which\\nhad been transmitted down through a series of consecrated hands from the days\\nof the mighty Puritan divines. Autographs of famous names were to be seen in\\nfaded ink on some of their fly-leaves; and there were marginal observations or\\ninterpolated pages closely covered with manuscript in illegible shorthand,\\nperhaps concealing matter of profound truth and wisdom. The world will never be\\nthe better for it. A few of the books were Latin folios, written by Catholic\\nauthors; others demolished Papistry, as with a sledge-hammer, in plain English.\\nA dissertation on the Book of Job—which only Job himself could have had\\npatience to read—filled at least a score of small, thick-set quartos, at\\nthe rate of two or three volumes to a chapter. Then there was a vast folio body\\nof divinity,—too corpulent a body, it might be feared, to comprehend the\\nspiritual element of religion. Volumes of this form dated back two hundred\\nyears or more, and were generally bound in black leather, exhibiting precisely\\nsuch an appearance as we should attribute to books of enchantment. Others\\nequally antique were of a size proper to be carried in the large waistcoat\\npockets of old times,—diminutive, but as black as their bulkier brethren,\\nand abundantly interfused with Greek and Latin quotations. These little old\\nvolumes impressed me as if they had been intended for very large ones, but had\\nbeen unfortunately blighted at an early stage of their growth.', 'The rain pattered upon the roof and the sky gloomed through the dusty\\ngarret-windows while I burrowed among these venerable books in search of any\\nliving thought which should burn like a coal of fire or glow like an\\ninextinguishable gem beneath the dead trumpery that had long hidden it. But I\\nfound no such treasure; all was dead alike; and I could not but muse deeply and\\nwonderingly upon the humiliating fact that the works of man’s intellect decay\\nlike those of his hands. Thought grows mouldy. What was good and nourishing\\nfood for the spirits of one generation affords no sustenance for the next.\\nBooks of religion, however, cannot be considered a fair test of the enduring\\nand vivacious properties of human thought, because such books so seldom really\\ntouch upon their ostensible subject, and have, therefore, so little business to\\nbe written at all. So long as an unlettered soul can attain to saving grace\\nthere would seem to be no deadly error in holding theological libraries to be\\naccumulations of, for the most part, stupendous impertinence.', 'Many of the books had accrued in the latter years of the last clergyman’s\\nlifetime. These threatened to be of even less interest than the elder works a\\ncentury hence to any curious inquirer who should then rummage then as I was\\ndoing now. Volumes of the Liberal Preacher and Christian Examiner, occasional\\nsermons, controversial pamphlets, tracts, and other productions of a like\\nfugitive nature, took the place of the thick and heavy volumes of past time. In\\na physical point of view, there was much the same difference as between a\\nfeather and a lump of lead; but, intellectually regarded, the specific gravity\\nof old and new was about upon a par. Both also were alike frigid. The elder\\nbooks nevertheless seemed to have been earnestly written, and might be\\nconceived to have possessed warmth at some former period; although, with the\\nlapse of time, the heated masses had cooled down even to the freezing-point.\\nThe frigidity of the modern productions, on the other hand, was characteristic\\nand inherent, and evidently had little to do with the writer’s qualities of\\nmind and heart. In fine, of this whole dusty heap of literature I tossed aside\\nall the sacred part, and felt myself none the less a Christian for eschewing\\nit. There appeared no hope of either mounting to the better world on a Gothic\\nstaircase of ancient folios or of flying thither on the wings of a modern\\ntract.', 'Nothing, strange to say, retained any sap except what had been written for the\\npassing day and year, without the remotest pretension or idea of permanence.\\nThere were a few old newspapers, and still older almanacs, which reproduced to\\nmy mental eye the epochs when they had issued from the press with a\\ndistinctness that was altogether unaccountable. It was as if I had found bits\\nof magic looking-glass among the books with the images of a vanished century in\\nthem. I turned my eyes towards the tattered picture above mentioned, and asked\\nof the austere divine wherefore it was that he and his brethren, after the most\\npainful rummaging and groping into their minds, had been able to produce\\nnothing half so real as these newspaper scribblers and almanac-makers had\\nthrown off in the effervescence of a moment. The portrait responded not; so I\\nsought an answer for myself. It is the age itself that writes newspapers and\\nalmanacs, which therefore have a distinct purpose and meaning at the time, and\\na kind of intelligible truth for all times; whereas most other\\nworks—being written by men who, in the very act, set themselves apart\\nfrom their age—are likely to possess little significance when new, and\\nnone at all when old. Genius, indeed, melts many ages into one, and thus\\neffects something permanent, yet still with a similarity of office to that of\\nthe more ephemeral writer. A work of genius is but the newspaper of a century,\\nor perchance of a hundred centuries.', 'Lightly as I have spoken of these old books, there yet lingers with me a\\nsuperstitious reverence for literature of all kinds. A bound volume has a charm\\nin my eyes similar to what scraps of manuscript possess for the good Mussulman.\\nHe imagines that those wind-wafted records are perhaps hallowed by some sacred\\nverse; and I, that every new book or antique one may contain the “open\\nsesame,”—the spell to disclose treasures hidden in some unsuspected cave\\nof Truth. Thus it was not without sadness that I turned away from the library\\nof the Old Manse.', 'Blessed was the sunshine when it came again at the close of another stormy day,\\nbeaming from the edge of the western horizon; while the massive firmament of\\nclouds threw down all the gloom it could, but served only to kindle the golden\\nlight into a more brilliant glow by the strongly contrasted shadows. Heaven\\nsmiled at the earth, so long unseen, from beneath its heavy eyelid. To-morrow\\nfor the hill-tops and the woodpaths.', 'Or it might be that Ellery Charming came up the avenue to join me in a fishing\\nexcursion on the river. Strange and happy times were those when we cast aside\\nall irksome forms and strait-laced habitudes and delivered ourselves up to the\\nfree air, to live like the Indians or any less conventional race during one\\nbright semicircle of the sun. Rowing our boat against the current, between wide\\nmeadows, we turned aside into the Assabeth. A more lovely stream than this, for\\na mile above its junction with the Concord, has never flowed on earth, nowhere,\\nindeed, except to lave the interior regions of a poet’s imagination. It is\\nsheltered from the breeze by woods and a hillside; so that elsewhere there\\nmight be a hurricane, and here scarcely a ripple across the shaded water. The\\ncurrent lingers along so gently that the mere force of the boatman’s will seems\\nsufficient to propel his craft against it. It comes flowing softly through the\\nmidmost privacy and deepest heart of a wood which whispers it to be quiet;\\nwhile the stream whispers back again from its sedgy borders, as if river and\\nwood were hushing one another to sleep. Yes; the river sleeps along its course\\nand dreams of the sky and of the clustering foliage, amid which fall showers of\\nbroken sunlight, imparting specks of vivid cheerfulness, in contrast with the\\nquiet depth of the prevailing tint. Of all this scene, the slumbering river has\\na dream-picture in its bosom. Which, after all, was the most real,—the\\npicture, or the original?—the objects palpable to our grosser senses, or\\ntheir apotheosis in the stream beneath? Surely the disembodied images stand in\\ncloser relation to the soul. But both the original and the reflection had here\\nan ideal charm; and, had it been a thought more wild, I could have fancied that\\nthis river had strayed forth out of the rich scenery of my companion’s inner\\nworld; only the vegetation along its banks should then have had an Oriental\\ncharacter.', 'Gentle and unobtrusive as the river is, yet the tranquil woods seem hardly\\nsatisfied to allow it passage. The trees are rooted on the very verge of the\\nwater, and dip their pendent branches into it. At one spot there is a lofty\\nbank, on the slope of which grow some hemlocks, declining across the stream\\nwith outstretched arms, as if resolute to take the plunge. In other places the\\nbanks are almost on a level with the water; so that the quiet congregation of\\ntrees set their feet in the flood, and are Fringed with foliage down to the\\nsurface. Cardinal-flowers kindle their spiral flames and illuminate the dark\\nnooks among the shrubbery. The pond-lily grows abundantly along the\\nmargin,—that delicious flower which, as Thoreau tells me, opens its\\nvirgin bosom to the first sunlight and perfects its being through the magic of\\nthat genial kiss. He has beheld beds of them unfolding in due succession as the\\nsunrise stole gradually from flower to flower,—a sight not to be hoped\\nfor unless when a poet adjusts his inward eye to a proper focus with the\\noutward organ. Grapevines here and there twine themselves around shrub and tree\\nand hang their clusters over the water within reach of the boatman’s hand.\\nOftentimes they unite two trees of alien race in an inextricable twine,\\nmarrying the hemlock and the maple against their will and enriching them with a\\npurple offspring of which neither is the parent. One of these ambitious\\nparasites has climbed into the upper branches of a tall white-pine, and is\\nstill ascending from bough to bough, unsatisfied till it shall crown the tree’s\\nairy summit with a wreath of its broad foliage and a cluster of its grapes.', 'The winding course of the stream continually shut out the scene behind us and\\nrevealed as calm and lovely a one before. We glided from depth to depth, and\\nbreathed new seclusion at every turn. The shy kingfisher flew from the withered\\nbranch close at hand to another at a distance, uttering a shrill cry of anger\\nor alarm. Ducks that had been floating there since the preceding eve were\\nstartled at our approach and skimmed along the glassy river, breaking its dark\\nsurface with a bright streak. The pickerel leaped from among the lilypads. The\\nturtle, sunning itself upon a rock or at the root of a tree, slid suddenly into\\nthe water with a plunge. The painted Indian who paddled his canoe along the\\nAssabeth three hundred years ago could hardly have seen a wilder gentleness\\ndisplayed upon its banks and reflected in its bosom than we did. Nor could the\\nsame Indian have prepared his noontide meal with more simplicity. We drew up\\nour skiff at some point where the overarching shade formed a natural bower, and\\nthere kindled a fire with the pine cones and decayed branches that lay strewn\\nplentifully around. Soon the smoke ascended among the trees, impregnated with a\\nsavory incense, not heavy, dull, and surfeiting, like the steam of cookery\\nwithin doors, but sprightly and piquant. The smell of our feast was akin to the\\nwoodland odors with which it mingled: there was no sacrilege committed by our\\nintrusion there: the sacred solitude was hospitable, and granted us free leave\\nto cook and eat in the recess that was at once our kitchen and banqueting-hall.\\nIt is strange what humble offices may be performed in a beautiful scene without\\ndestroying its poetry. Our fire, red gleaming among the trees, and we beside\\nit, busied with culinary rites and spreading out our meal on a mossgrown log,\\nall seemed in unison with the river gliding by and the foliage rustling over\\nus. And, what was strangest, neither did our mirth seem to disturb the\\npropriety of the solemn woods; although the hobgoblins of the old wilderness\\nand the will-of-the-wisps that glimmered in the marshy places might have come\\ntrooping to share our table-talk and have added their shrill laughter to our\\nmerriment. It was the very spot in which to utter the extremest nonsense or the\\nprofoundest wisdom, or that ethereal product of the mind which partakes of\\nboth, and may become one or the other, in correspondence with the faith and\\ninsight of the auditor.', 'So, amid sunshine and shadow, rustling leaves and sighing waters, up gushed our\\ntalk like the babble of a fountain. The evanescent spray was Ellery’s; and his,\\ntoo, the lumps of golden thought that lay glimmering in the fountain’s bed and\\nbrightened both our faces by the reflection. Could he have drawn out that\\nvirgin gold, and stamped it with the mint-mark that alone gives currency, the\\nworld might have had the profit, and he the fame. My mind was the richer merely\\nby the knowledge that it was there. But the chief profit of those wild days, to\\nhim and me, lay not in any definite idea, not in any angular or rounded truth,\\nwhich we dug out of the shapeless mass of problematical stuff, but in the\\nfreedom which we thereby won from all custom and conventionalism and fettering\\ninfluences of man on man. We were so free to-day that it was impossible to be\\nslaves again to-morrow. When we crossed the threshold of the house or trod the\\nthronged pavements of a city, still the leaves of the trees that overhang the\\nAssabeth were whispering to us, “Be free! be free!” Therefore along that shady\\nriver-bank there are spots, marked with a heap of ashes and half-consumed\\nbrands, only less sacred in my remembrance than the hearth of a household fire.', 'And yet how sweet, as we floated homeward adown the golden river at\\nsunset,—how sweet was it to return within the system of human society,\\nnot as to a dungeon and a chain, but as to a stately edifice, whence we could\\ngo forth at will into state—her simplicity! How gently, too, did the\\nsight of the Old Manse, best seen from the river, overshadowed with its willow\\nand all environed about with the foliage of its orchard and avenue,—how\\ngently did its gray, homely aspect rebuke the speculative extravagances of the\\nday! It had grown sacred in connection with the artificial life against which\\nwe inveighed; it had been a home for many years, in spite of all; it was my\\nhome too; and, with these thoughts, it seemed to me that all the artifice and\\nconventionalism of life was but an impalpable thinness upon its surface, and\\nthat the depth below was none the worse for it. Once, as we turned our boat to\\nthe bank, there was a cloud, in the shape of an immensely gigantic figure of a\\nhound, couched above the house, as if keeping guard over it. Gazing at this\\nsymbol, I prayed that the upper influences might long protect the institutions\\nthat had grown out of the heart of mankind.', 'If ever my readers should decide to give up civilized life, cities, houses, and\\nwhatever moral or material enormities in addition to these the perverted\\ningenuity of our race has contrived, let it be in the early autumn. Then Nature\\nwill love him better than at any other season, and will take him to her bosom\\nwith a more motherly tenderness. I could scarcely endure the roof of the old\\nhouse above me in those first autumnal days. How early in the summer, too, the\\nprophecy of autumn comes! Earlier in some years than in others; sometimes even\\nin the first weeks of July. There is no other feeling like what is caused by\\nthis faint, doubtful, yet real perception—if it be not rather a\\nforeboding—of the year’s decay, so blessedly sweet and sad in the same\\nbreath.', 'Did I say that there was no feeling like it? Ah, but there is a\\nhalf-acknowledged melancholy like to this when we stand in the perfected vigor\\nof our life and feel that Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the\\nnext work of his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.', 'I have forgotten whether the song of the cricket be not as early a token of\\nautumn’s approach as any other,—that song which may be called an audible\\nstillness; for though very loud and heard afar, yet the mind does not take note\\nof it as a sound, so completely is its individual existence merged among the\\naccompanying characteristics of the season. Alas for the pleasant summertime!\\nIn August the grass is still verdant on the hills and in the valleys; the\\nfoliage of the trees is as dense as ever and as green; the flowers gleam forth\\nin richer abundance along the margin of the river and by the stone walls and\\ndeep among the woods; the days, too, are as fervid now as they were a month\\nago; and yet in every breath of wind and in every beam of sunshine we hear the\\nwhispered farewell and behold the parting smile of a dear friend. There is a\\ncoolness amid all the heat, a mildness in the blazing noon. Not a breeze can\\nstir but it thrills us with the breath of autumn. A pensive glory is seen in\\nthe far, golden gleams, among the shadows of the trees. The flowers—even\\nthe brightest of them, and they are the most gorgeous of the year—have\\nthis gentle sadness wedded to their pomp, and typify the character of the\\ndelicious time each within itself. The brilliant cardinal-flower has never\\nseemed gay to me.', 'Still later in the season Nature’s tenderness waxes stronger. It is impossible\\nnot to be fond of our mother now; for she is so fond of us! At other periods\\nshe does not make this impression on me, or only at rare intervals; but in\\nthose genial days of autumn, when she has perfected her harvests and\\naccomplished every needful thing that was given her to do, then she overflows\\nwith a blessed superfluity of love. She has leisure to caress her children now.\\nIt is good to be alive and at such times. Thank Heaven for breath—yes,\\nfor mere breath—when it is made up of a heavenly breeze like this! It\\ncomes with a real kiss upon our cheeks; it would linger fondly around us if it\\nmight; but, since it must be gone, it embraces us with its whole kindly heart\\nand passes onward to embrace likewise the next thing that it meets. A blessing\\nis flung abroad and scattered far and wide over the earth, to be gathered up by\\nall who choose. I recline upon the still unwithered grass and whisper to\\nmyself, “O perfect day! O beautiful world! O beneficent God!” And it is the\\npromise of a blessed eternity; for our Creator would never have made such\\nlovely days and have given us the deep hearts to enjoy them, above and beyond\\nall thought, unless we were meant to be immortal. This sunshine is the golden\\npledge thereof. It beams through the gates of paradise and shows us glimpses\\nfar inward.', 'By and by, in a little time, the outward world puts on a drear austerity. On\\nsome October morning there is a heavy hoarfrost on the grass and along the tops\\nof the fences; and at sunrise the leaves fall from the trees of our avenue,\\nwithout a breath of wind, quietly descending by their own weight. All summer\\nlong they have murmured like the noise of waters; they have roared loudly while\\nthe branches were wrestling with the thunder-gust; they have made music both\\nglad and solemn; they have attuned my thoughts by their quiet sound as I paced\\nto and fro beneath the arch of intermingling boughs. Now they can only rustle\\nunder my feet. Henceforth the gray parsonage begins to assume a larger\\nimportance, and draws to its fireside,—for the abomination of the\\nair-tight stove is reserved till wintry weather,—draws closer and closer\\nto its fireside the vagrant impulses that had gone wandering about through the\\nsummer.', 'When summer was dead and buried the Old Manse became as lonely as a hermitage.\\nNot that ever—in my time at least—it had been thronged with\\ncompany; but, at no rare intervals, we welcomed some friend out of the dusty\\nglare and tumult of the world, and rejoiced to share with him the transparent\\nobscurity that was floating over us. In one respect our precincts were like the\\nEnchanted Ground through which the pilgrim travelled on his way to the\\nCelestial City. The guests, each and all, felt a slumberous influence upon\\nthem; they fell asleep in chairs, or took a more deliberate siesta on the sofa,\\nor were seen stretched among the shadows of the orchard, looking up dreamily\\nthrough the boughs. They could not have paid a more acceptable compliment to my\\nabode nor to my own qualities as a host. I held it as a proof that they left\\ntheir cares behind them as they passed between the stone gate-posts at the\\nentrance of our avenue, and that the so powerful opiate was the abundance of\\npeace and quiet within and all around us. Others could give them pleasure and\\namusement or instruction,—these could be picked up anywhere; but it was\\nfor me to give them rest,—rest in a life of trouble. What better could be\\ndone for those weary and world-worn spirits?—for him whose career of\\nperpetual action was impeded and harassed by the rarest of his powers and the\\nrichest of his acquirements?—for another who had thrown his ardent heart\\nfrom earliest youth into the strife of politics, and now, perchance, began to\\nsuspect that one lifetime is too brief for the accomplishment of any lofty\\naim?—for her oil whose feminine nature had been imposed the heavy gift of\\nintellectual power, such as a strong man might have staggered under, and with\\nit the necessity to act upon the world?—in a word, not to multiply\\ninstances, what better could be done for anybody who came within our magic\\ncircle than to throw the spell of a tranquil spirit over him? And when it had\\nwrought its full effect, then we dismissed him, with but misty reminiscences,\\nas if he had been dreaming of us.', 'Were I to adopt a pet idea as so many people do, and fondle it in my embraces\\nto the exclusion of all others, it would be, that the great want which mankind\\nlabors under at this present period is sleep. The world should recline its vast\\nhead on the first convenient pillow and take an age-long nap. It has gone\\ndistracted through a morbid activity, and, while preternaturally wide awake, is\\nnevertheless tormented by visions that seem real to it now, but would assume\\ntheir true aspect and character were all things once set right by an interval\\nof sound repose. This is the only method of getting rid of old delusions and\\navoiding new ones; of regenerating our race, so that it might in due time awake\\nas an infant out of dewy slumber; of restoring to us the simple perception of\\nwhat is right and the single-hearted desire to achieve it, both of which have\\nlong been lost in consequence of this weary activity of brain and torpor or\\npassion of the heart that now afflict the universe. Stimulants, the only mode\\nof treatment hitherto attempted, cannot quell the disease; they do but heighten\\nthe delirium.', 'Let not the above paragraph ever be quoted against the author; for, though\\ntinctured with its modicum of truth, it is the result and expression of what he\\nknew, while he was writing, to be but a distorted survey of the state and\\nprospects of mankind. There were circumstances around me which made it\\ndifficult to view the world precisely as it exists; for, severe and sober as\\nwas the Old Manse, it was necessary to go but a little way beyond its threshold\\nbefore meeting with stranger moral shapes of men than might have been\\nencountered elsewhere in a circuit of a thousand miles.', 'These hobgoblins of flesh and blood were attracted thither by the widespreading\\ninfluence of a great original thinker, who had his earthly abode at the\\nopposite extremity of our village. His mind acted upon other minds of a certain\\nconstitution with wonderful magnetism, and drew many men upon long pilgrimages\\nto speak with him face to face. Young visionaries—to whom just so much of\\ninsight had been imparted as to make life all a labyrinth around\\nthem—came to seek the clew that should guide them out of their\\nself-involved bewilderment. Gray-headed theorists—whose systems, at first\\nair, had finally imprisoned them in an iron framework—travelled painfully\\nto his door, not to ask deliverance, but to invite the free spirit into their\\nown thraldom. People that had lighted on a new thought or a thought that they\\nfancied new, came to Emerson, as the finder of a glittering gem hastens to a\\nlapidary, to ascertain its quality and value. Uncertain, troubled, earnest\\nwanderers through the midnight of the moral world beheld his intellectual fire\\nas a beacon burning on a hill-top, and, climbing the difficult ascent, looked\\nforth into the surrounding obscurity more hopefully than hitherto. The light\\nrevealed objects unseen before,—mountains, gleaming lakes, glimpses of a\\ncreation among the chaos; but also, as was unavoidable, it attracted bats and\\nowls and the whole host of night birds, which flapped their dusky wings against\\nthe gazer’s eyes, and sometimes were mistaken for fowls of angelic feather.\\nSuch delusions always hover nigh whenever a beacon-fire of truth is kindled.', 'For myself, there bad been epochs of my life when I, too, might have asked of\\nthis prophet the master word that should solve me the riddle of the universe;\\nbut now, being happy, I felt as if there were no question to be put, and\\ntherefore admired Emerson as a poet, of deep beauty and austere tenderness, but\\nsought nothing from him as a philosopher. It was good, nevertheless, to meet\\nhim in the woodpaths, or sometimes in our avenue, with that pure, intellectual\\ngleam diffused about his presence like the garment of a shining one; and be, so\\nquiet, so simple, so without pretension, encountering each man alive as if\\nexpecting to receive more than he could impart. And, in truth, the heart of\\nmany an ordinary man had, perchance, inscriptions which he could not read. But\\nit was impossible to dwell in his vicinity without inhaling more or less the\\nmountain atmosphere of his lofty thought, which, in the brains of some people,\\nwrought a singular giddiness,—new truth being as heady as new wine. Never\\nwas a poor little country village infested with such a variety of queer,\\nstrangely dressed, oddly behaved mortals, most of whom took upon themselves to\\nbe important agents of the world’s destiny, yet were simply bores of a very\\nintense water. Such, I imagine, is the invariable character of persons who\\ncrowd so closely about an original thinker as to draw in his unuttered breath\\nand thus become imbued with a false originality. This triteness of novelty is\\nenough to make any man of common-sense blaspheme at all ideas of less than a\\ncentury’s standing, and pray that the world may be petrified and rendered\\nimmovable in precisely the worst moral and physical state that it ever yet\\narrived at, rather than be benefited by such schemes of such philosophers.', 'And now I begin to feel—and perhaps should have sooner felt—that we\\nhave talked enough of the Old Manse. Mine honored reader, it may be, will\\nvilify the poor author as an egotist for babbling through so many pages about a\\nmossgrown country parsonage, and his life within its walls, and on the river,\\nand in the woods, and the influences that wrought upon him from all these\\nsources. My conscience, however, does not reproach me with betraying anything\\ntoo sacredly individual to be revealed by a human spirit to its brother or\\nsister spirit. How narrow-how shallow and scanty too—is the stream of\\nthought that has been flowing from my pen, compared with the broad tide of dim\\nemotions, ideas, and associations which swell around me from that portion of my\\nexistence! How little have I told! and of that little, how almost nothing is\\neven tinctured with any quality that makes it exclusively my own! Has the\\nreader gone wandering, hand in hand with me, through the inner passages of my\\nbeing? and have we groped together into all its chambers and examined their\\ntreasures or their rubbish? Not so. We have been standing on the greensward,\\nbut just within the cavern’s mouth, where the common sunshine is free to\\npenetrate, and where every footstep is therefore free to come. I have appealed\\nto no sentiment or sensibilities save such as are diffused among us all. So far\\nas I am a man of really individual attributes I veil my face; nor am I, nor\\nhave I ever been, one of those supremely hospitable people who serve up their\\nown hearts, delicately fried, with brain sauce, as a tidbit for their beloved\\npublic.', 'Glancing back over what I have written, it seems but the scattered\\nreminiscences of a single summer. In fairyland there is no measurement of time;\\nand, in a spot so sheltered from the turmoil of life’s ocean, three years\\nhastened away with a noiseless flight, as the breezy sunshine chases the\\ncloud-shadows across the depths of a still valley. Now came hints, growing more\\nand more distinct, that the owner of the old house was pining for his native\\nair. Carpenters next, appeared, making a tremendous racket among the\\noutbuildings, strewing the green grass with pine shavings and chips of chestnut\\njoists, and vexing the whole antiquity of the place with their discordant\\nrenovations. Soon, moreover, they divested our abode of the veil of woodbine\\nwhich had crept over a large portion of its southern face. All the aged mosses\\nwere cleared unsparingly away; and there were horrible whispers about brushing\\nup the external walls with a coat of paint,—a purpose as little to my\\ntaste as might be that of rouging the venerable cheeks of one’s grandmother.\\nBut the hand that renovates is always more sacrilegious than that which\\ndestroys. In fine, we gathered up our household goods, drank a farewell cup of\\ntea in our pleasant little breakfast-room,—delicately fragrant tea, an\\nunpurchasable luxury, one of the many angel gifts that had fallen like dew upon\\nus,—and passed forth between the tall stone gate-posts as uncertain as\\nthe wandering Arabs where our tent might next be pitched. Providence took me by\\nthe hand, and—an oddity of dispensation which, I trust, there is no\\nirreverence in smiling at—has led me, as the newspapers announce while I\\nam writing, from the Old Manse into a custom-house. As a story-teller, I have\\noften contrived strange vicissitudes for my imaginary personages, but none like\\nthis.', 'The treasure of intellectual gold which I hoped to find in our secluded\\ndwelling had never come to light. No profound treatise of ethics, no\\nphilosophic history, no novel even, that could stand unsupported on its edges.\\nAll that I had to show, as a man of letters, were these, few tales and essays,\\nwhich had blossomed out like flowers in the calm summer of my heart and mind.\\nSave editing (an easy task) the journal of my friend of many years, the African\\nCruiser, I had done nothing else. With these idle weeds and withering blossoms\\nI have intermixed some that were produced long ago,—old, faded things,\\nreminding me of flowers pressed between the leaves of a book,—and now\\noffer the bouquet, such as it is, to any whom it may please. These fitful\\nsketches, with so little of external life about them, yet claiming no\\nprofundity of purpose,—so reserved, even while they sometimes seem so\\nfrank,—often but half in earnest, and never, even when most so,\\nexpressing satisfactorily the thoughts which they profess to image,—such\\ntrifles, I truly feel, afford no solid basis for a literary reputation.\\nNevertheless, the public—if my limited number of readers, whom I venture\\nto regard rather as a circle of friends, may be termed a public—will\\nreceive them the more kindly, as the last offering, the last collection of this\\nnature which it is my purpose ever to put forth. Unless I could do better, I\\nhave done enough in this kind. For myself the book will always retain one\\ncharm,—as reminding me of the river, with its delightful solitudes, and\\nof the avenue, the garden, and the orchard, and especially the dear Old Manse,\\nwith the little study on its western side, and the sunshine glimmering through\\nthe willow branches while I wrote.', 'Let the reader, if he will do me so much honor, imagine himself my guest, and\\nthat, having seen whatever may be worthy of notice within and about the Old\\nManse, he has finally been ushered into my study. There, after seating him in\\nan antique elbow-chair, an heirloom of the house, I take forth a roll of\\nmanuscript and entreat his attention to the following tales,—an act of\\npersonal inhospitality, however, which I never was guilty of, nor ever will be,\\neven to my worst enemy.']]\n"]}],"source":["#テクストを読み取り、前処理\n","#最終的なテーブル\n","texts_table=[]\n","texts_table_temp=[]\n","num=0\n","text_temp=[]\n","file_list=[]\n","#ディレクトリの中のテクストを一つずつ読み込む\n","for v in glob.glob(dir+folder+'/*.html'):\n","  with open(v) as f:\n","    text=f.read()\n","    i = re.sub(dir+folder+'/','',v)\n","    i = re.sub(r'-images.html','',i)\n","    file_list.append(i)\n","    print(i)\n","\n","    keytext='p'\n","    soup = BeautifulSoup(text,'lxml')\n","    elem = soup.find_all(keytext)\n","\n","    exempt=['Title:', 'Author:', 'Release date:', 'Language:', 'Credits:', 'Edwards, 321 Broadway.', '1856', 'Author of “Typee,”']\n","    def exempt_flag(text):\n","      sum = 0\n","      for q in exempt:\n","        if q in text:\n","          sum += 1\n","      return sum\n","\n","    text_temp2=[]\n","    for i in elem:\n","      j=i.text\n","      if exempt_flag(j)==0:\n","        #前処理（[]で囲まれた数字や注や前後の空白などを消す）\n","        j=preprocess_1(j)\n","        j=preprocess_2(j)\n","        #テキストを仮の変数に追加\n","        text_temp2.append(j)\n","    #1ファイル分まとめて変数に追加\n","    text_temp.append(text_temp2)\n","print(text_temp)\n","#text_tempに各ファイルのテキストが入る text_temp[0], text_temp[1]など\n","#1.gutenbergからテキストを読みこんで、段落ごとに、変数に入れる作業終わり\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"executionInfo":{"elapsed":290,"status":"ok","timestamp":1727338634832,"user":{"displayName":"htakehiro001n Chuo University","userId":"09348875088842447922"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"OFmAgotZIaAZ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# 2.その後、段落ごとに大規模自然言語LLMで単語埋め込みword embeddingsをしてテキストを数値化\n","\n","#わかりやすいように変数に入れる。The Old Manse->Old_Manse The Piazza Tales->Piazza\n","file_list2={'The Old Manse': 'pg9221', 'The Piazza Tales': 'pg15859', 'Nature': 'pg29433', 'Essays_First': 'pg2944'}\n","for i in range(len(file_list)):\n","  if file_list[i]==file_list2['The Old Manse']:\n","    Old_Manse=text_temp[i]\n","#for i in range(len(file_list)):\n","  if file_list[i]==file_list2['The Piazza Tales']:\n","    Piazza=text_temp[i]\n","  if file_list[i]==file_list2['Nature']:\n","    Nature=text_temp[i]\n","  if file_list[i]==file_list2['Essays_First']:\n","    Essays_First=text_temp[i]\n","Natures=Nature+Essays_First+Old_Manse\n","Piazza0=Piazza\n","Piazza=Piazza[0:96]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":71},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":292,"status":"ok","timestamp":1727338652996,"user":{"displayName":"htakehiro001n Chuo University","userId":"09348875088842447922"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"vaPWeQS3CEGw","outputId":"6a321808-c153-4adf-c890-ea4ee86017a8"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'But, every night, when the curtain falls, truth comes in with darkness.

rough-hewn stone (the gate itself having fallen\\nfrom its hinges at some unknown epoch) we beheld the gray front of the old\\nparsonage, terminating the vista of an avenue of black-ash trees. It was now a\\ntwelvemonth since the funeral procession of the venerable clergyman, its last\\ninhabitant, had turned from that gateway towards the village burying-ground.\\nThe wheel-track leading to the door, as well as the whole breadth of the\\navenue, was almost overgrown with grass, affording dainty mouthfuls to two or\\nthree vagrant cows and an old white horse who had his own living to pick up\\nalong the roadside. The glimmering shadows that lay half asleep between the\\ndoor of the house and the public highway were a kind of spiritual medium, seen\\nthrough which the edifice had not quite the aspect of belonging to the material\\nworld. Certainly it had little in common with those ordinary abodes which stand\\nso imminent upon the road that every passer-by can thrust his head, as it were,\\ninto the domestic circle. From these quiet windows the figures of passing\\ntravellers looked too remote and dim to disturb the sense of privacy. In its\\nnear retirement and accessible seclusion, it was the very spot for the\\nresidence of a clergyman,—a man not estranged from human life, yet\\nenveloped, in the midst of it, with a veil woven of intermingled gloom and\\nbrightness. It was worthy to have been one of the time-honored parsonages of\\nEngland, in which, through many generations, a succession of holy occupants\\npass from youth to age, and bequeath each an inheritance of sanctity to pervade\\nthe house and hover over it as with an atmosphere.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":37}],"source":["Natures[567]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":425},"id":"cJXwJdTYIvea","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1727340029106,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":1553,"user":{"displayName":"htakehiro001n

The lover of\n","nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each\n","other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood.

Nature says,—he is my creature, and maugre all his impertinent griefs,\n","he shall be glad with me. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and\n","season yields its tribute of delight; for every hour and change corresponds to\n","and authorizes a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest\n","midnight.

In the woods, we return to\n","reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life,—no disgrace,\n","no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the\n","bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite\n","space,—all mean egotism vanishes.
